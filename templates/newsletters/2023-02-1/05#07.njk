			<p>One of the sweetest Romance animes of all time. The plot follows a boy named Nasa Yuzaki, a responsible and hardworking middle schooler who is all set to get into the high school of his dreams, goes out on a snowy night and his eyes falls upon an extremely beautiful girl, the “cutest girl in the universe”, as he deems her to be, across the road. He runs towards her and a truck bashes into him, and thus begins the story of the only isekai anime in this list, or so you thought! But surprisingly, the girl in question manages to rescue him. He manages to propose to her before eventually passing out from significant blood loss. He skipped high school and is now working as a freelance developer two years later. Out of the blue, the girl shows up at his doorstep at his 18th birthday with… guess what? A marriage registration form; well it is legal to get married at the age of 18 for boys in Japan. The bond that develops between an oddly intelligent and capable boy and a stoic but lovely girl is sweet to the point of being diabetic. Your interest will be maintained by the healthy development of their connection and your curiosity will be piqued by the underlying air of mystery. We'll let you decide how to judge the Opening, just be sure to pay attention to it. It might not be the top anime on the list, but the anime which is the most rewatchable alongside Kaguya sama and Tsuredure Children.</p>
