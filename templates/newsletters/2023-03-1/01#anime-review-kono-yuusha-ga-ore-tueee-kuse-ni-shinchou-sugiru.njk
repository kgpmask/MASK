			<p>Overall, &ldquo;Shinchou Yuusha: Kono Yuusha ga Ore Tueee Kuse ni Shinchou Sugiru&rdquo;, damn that's long (also that's what …),  is a fun and entertaining anime that is worth watching. The combination of comedy, action, and great animation truly make it an enjoyable experience from start to finish. So, if you're looking for a lighthearted anime that will make you laugh and keep you entertained, be sure to give this one a watch! Or, don't watch it. It's not like I want you to watch it!

			<p>Have you ever thought, &ldquo;What if I get mugged on the way to class?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What if a level 80 boss appears as soon as you start the game at level 1?&rdquo;. Do you pack dozens of things, thinking up scenarios where they may be useful, before going on a trip and end up with 2 suitcases for a small trip? That&rsquo;s exactly what the MC of this anime, which has a really long name but can be referred to with &ldquo;<i>Cautious Hero</i>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>TUEEE</i>&rdquo; (pronounced Tsu-ē, meaning OP - overpowered), thinks, or overthinks, before making any decision.</p>

			<p><i>Cautious Hero</i> is an anime that follows the journey of <i>Seiya Ryuuguuin</i>, the overly cautious and overthinking, but strangely super calm, hero who is summoned to a generic fantasy world to save it from destruction, yada yada, you know the works. However, unlike other isekai heroes who are gifted a goddess, or are traumatised and perverted, or have the ability to start over on dying, this hero is, well …, as the name suggests, just extremely cautious and that&rsquo;s about it. This means that he doesn&rsquo;t leave anything to chance and is prepared for the worst. He seems to have taken the proverb, &ldquo;Prepare for the worst, but hope for the best?&rdquo; to the ultra pro max level.</p>

			<p>Coming to the overly endowed goddess, <i>Ristarte</i>,  who seems like a ripoff of a certain useless goddess, is also … extremely useless and just wants the hero to do all the work for her. The banter between <i>Seiya</i> and <i>Ristarte</i> is highly entertaining, as they have completely opposite personalities and constantly clash with each other. We see a gap between the seriously animated Seiya and the comically drawn &ldquo;goddess&rdquo;. The faces that <i>Ristarte</i> makes, makes for quality meme material.</p>

			<p>On a serious note, the animation and sound design of <i>Cautious Hero</i> are excellent, with smooth and detailed animation that brings the characters to life. The soundtrack is also great, with a mix of energetic and emotional tracks that complements the various scenes throughout the series. The comic elements hit home and the gags are quite enjoyable. The action scenes are well animated and fluid. The anime is filled with funny moments, thanks to <i>Seiya&rsquo;s</i> absurd levels of caution and calmness, as he goes to great lengths to prepare for battles that he may never face.</p>

			<p><i>Cautious Hero</i> is an excellent anime that is well worth watching. With a great balance of comedy, action, and serious moments, along with stunning visuals and memorable characters, it is sure to entertain and leave a lasting impression on viewers as it did on me. I usually forget about most isekai anime as soon as it&rsquo;s over, partly because of the huge number of isekai anime out there and rest because of skill issue, but this anime is one that I&rsquo;ll probably never forget. Why not give it a try? Not that like I care. </p>
