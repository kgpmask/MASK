			<h3>Brief Summary</h3>
			<p>Tokyo Ghoul is a dark fantasy anime adaptation of the manga made by Ishida Sui, and the TV anime was produced by Studio Pierrot. There are also some horror elements. The main character of the story is Kaneki Ken, an ordinary college student, and his life changes when he meets a girl at the café. Little did he know that she is actually a Ghoul, a carnivorous species only able to feed on humans and even other ghouls too, and during the night, he is attacked and almost got killed and eaten by her. He was saved by an emergency operation, when a ghoul’s organs were transplanted into his body. Basically, he became a half-human half-human, or, as many people called him, the One-Eyed Ghoul. His struggle and the tragedies start as he enters the ghoul world.</p>
			<h3>Characters</h3>
			<p>Here is where Tokyo Ghoul suffers from the most and ultimately hinders enjoyment of the show. The show has a lot of side characters. A new character is introduced maybe every 1 to 2 episodes and none of these characters get enough screen time and character development. The fault of this is partly due to its 1-cour situation, but it’s also because of the mini-plot format of the show. A new character is introduced who interacts with Kaneki in some way before being pushed to the side-lines a couple of episodes later and a new character takes the stage. There is barely any exposition for the side characters and the way they were simply dumped. The main characters themselves are regrettably 2-dimensional. Kaneki’s initial panic with his newfound situation was acceptable at first but he never grew out of his timidness despite the abundant characters and small setting he was confined to. Unfortunately, the lack of development for the side characters also meant Kaneki’s character development also suffered as a result. Kaneki himself always seems to be in helpless situations which he can’t get out of. This is definitely one of the major setbacks of the show.</p>
			<h3>Art & Animation</h3>
			<p>The animation is slick and smooth. The (very few) fights and battles are nice to watch. The weapons, quninque and kagune, were an interesting concept for the show and there were enough different types to show off. The show tended to lean towards more vivid colours in its art style and wasn’t afraid to use its full range of colours which I thought was a good decision for the show to make. The characters themselves are distinct from one another in their art design and colour and I particularly liked how a character’s colour was associated with their personality. It’s a welcome change from other anime where characters look way too similar to one another. The OP and ED sequences were great to watch and is one of the few shows where I don’t skip its sequences. I especially like the theme of contrast and reflection used in the OP.</p>
			<h3>Music</h3>
			<p>Tokyo Ghoul’s sound direction is perfect. Overall effects in fight scenes were synced well and so was background noise. Each character had their own defined voice and the voice acting complimented well with the art and colour style. That is to say, their voices were a little more on the melodramatic side. But it was used to good effect in presenting their own personalities and character. The OP and ED are both fantastic and fit well into the tone of the show, or rather the tone the show was trying to show.</p>
			<h3>Enjoyment</h3>
			<p>I’ll admit to enjoying it enough. It wasn’t anything special in the end but it’s a decent show to watch if you’re looking for something to pass the time. If you were expecting any level of depth then you definitely won’t find it here. The show had a lot of potential in presenting the different aspects and perspectives between ghouls and humans and failed to capitalize. Unfortunately, in the end the show is average at best. It wasn’t the fault of the staff entirely as it could have benefited from more episodes, but the adaptation of the source material was mismanaged. For all its visual style it could not save the show from its muddled storytelling.</p>
