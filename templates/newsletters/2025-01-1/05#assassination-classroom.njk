			<p>As a college student, watching Assassination Classroom felt like opening a window in a stuffy, lifeless lecture hall. The show isn’t just about a bunch of kids trying to assassinate their overpowered alien teacher, Koro-sensei. It’s about the kind of teaching we all secretly (or not-so-secretly) wish we had.</p>

			<p>Watching Koro-sensei teach his students with energy, empathy, and ingenuity made me realize just how mundane and frustrating my own classes have become. While he’s out there dodging bullets and blowing up mountains to teach his students life lessons, I’m here in a classroom where slides are treated as sacred texts, professors are allergic to creativity, and even glancing at your phone feels like committing a felony.</p>

			<p>Let me break down the lessons Koro-sensei taught me, and how they clash spectacularly with my college reality.</p>

			<hr>
			<hr><br>

			<h3>1. Slides that could put you in a coma / Slides: The Modern day sleep potion</h3>

			<p>My professors seem to have a binding contract with PowerPoint, treating slides like they’re the pinnacle of education. They read directly off the screen, in a tone so lifeless it could make even caffeine give up. Imagine a slide titled "Importance of Topic X," and the professor just drones, “This slide explains the importance of Topic X.” Wow, revolutionary insight.</p>

			<p>They treat them like the gospel, reading them word-for-word without so much as a pause for drama. And let me tell you, they’re not even good slides. The occasional misspelling makes me wonder if their preparation strategy involves a blindfold and a dartboard.</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, Koro-sensei would never settle for something so basic. He doesn’t just read to his students—he dives headfirst into their world. He’d turn that slide into an explosive demonstration involving watermelons, fireworks, and a speedboat—just to get the point across. My professors, on the other hand, would probably panic if the projector broke and cancel the class entirely, because they’ve got nothing else to offer.</p>

			<hr><br>

			<h3>2. No Phones, No Naps, No Freedom</h3>

			<p>Koro-sensei’s classroom is an open battlefield of learning. If Koro-sensei walked into our classroom, he’d probably say, “Use your phones, take a nap, heck, do a backflip if it helps you focus!” My professors? They patrol the rows like hawks, ready to pounce if you so much as glance at your phone. Heaven forbid you check a message or, worse, Google something relevant to the lecture.</p>

			<p>And don’t even dream about napping. They’d rather you sit there, wide-eyed, absorbing absolutely nothing, than let you catch a sneaky 5-minute power nap. The moment you lean back in your chair or rest your head on your hand, they pounce with the precision of a hawk. “Is this class boring you?” they ask, as if their monotone delivery and endless slides didn’t answer that question already. Koro-sensei? He’d toss me a pillow and say, “Recharge for five minutes; you’ll need the energy for the assassination drill later!”</p>

			<hr><br>

			<h3>3. “Engagement” vs “Entanglement”</h3>

			<p>Koro-Sensei is the kind of teacher who’d use your hobbies, interests, and even your insecurities to create lessons you’d never forget. My professors? Their idea of engagement is asking, “Any questions?” while glaring at us like we’re trespassing on their nap time.</p>

			<p>But when you actually ask a question, they look at you like you just confessed to a crime. Sometimes, they don’t even bother answering properly—they just vaguely gesture at the slide and say, “It’s written here.” Koro-sensei, though? He would’ve answered with a full demonstration, complete with sound effects, metaphors, and maybe a fireworks display.</p>

			<hr><br>

			<h3>4. Why Can’t We Just… Work on our Stuff?</h3>

			<p>The sheer audacity of professors to demand our undivided attention while teaching badly is mind-boggling. Sometimes, all I want to do is quietly work on a project for another class, catch up on assignments, or just scroll through memes to survive the lecture. But no—my professors insist on undivided attention while droning on about things I could read faster myself. Koro-sensei would’ve turned this into an opportunity: “Work on what inspires you! Just make sure you assassinate the learning targets by the end!”</p>

			<hr><br>

			<h3>5. Failure: The Forbidden Topic</h3>

			<p>Koro-sensei teaches his students that failure is just a stepping stone. He encourages them to mess up—because every mistake is an opportunity to learn. My professors, on the other hand, treat failure like a moral failing. Miss one assignment, and you’re labelled as a slacker for the rest of the semester. Got a D grade? Might as well pack up your dreams and head for the hills.</p>

			<p>Imagine if professors encouraged risk-taking instead of punishing every misstep. Koro-sensei would’ve turned failures into battle scars of learning. I’d kill (figuratively) for a teacher who says, “You’re bad at this right now, but let’s make you great.” Instead, I get, “The average grade is B. Try harder.”</p>

			<hr><br>

			<h3>6. Overemphasis on Obedience</h3>

			<p>There’s this strange obsession with discipline in college. My professors act like they’re drill sergeants, demanding perfect silence and unwavering attention. Koro-sensei, on the other hand, embraces chaos. He knows that a little freedom and laughter lead to better learning. In his class, you’d hear laughter and the occasional explosion, but everyone would still ace their exams.</p>

			<p>In my classes, it’s all about control. No talking. No laughing. No breathing too loudly. It’s like attending a live reading of the world’s most boring audiobook.</p>

			<hr><br>

			<h3>7. They Take Themselves Way Too Seriously</h3>

			<p>One thing I adore about Koro-sensei is how he doesn’t mind being the butt of the joke. Koro-sensei wears costumes, cracks jokes, and embraces chaos to connect with his students. My professors? Their egos are more fragile than my Wi-Fi connection. If you so much as chuckle during class, they’ll glare at you like you just insulted their ancestors.</p>

			<p>They act like they’re delivering a TED Talk to an audience of Nobel laureates. Smile too much, and they’ll glare at you. Laugh at a funny example, and they’ll think you’re mocking their authority. They forget that learning isn’t supposed to feel like attending a funeral for your brain cells.</p>

			<hr><br>

			<h3>8. The Fine Art of Roasting with Love</h3>

			<p>Koro-sensei’s insults are legendary, but they come with a purpose. When he calls Nagisa a “tiny, adorable assassin” or Karma a “lazy genius,” it’s always to push them toward their potential. My professors? If they roast you, it’s accidental, like when they mispronounce your name so badly that you start questioning your own identity.</p>

			<p>Imagine if they actually knew us well enough to joke like that. But nah, they’re too busy squinting at the attendance sheet, trying to figure out if you’re even in the right class.</p>

			<hr><br>

			<h3>9. Innovation? What’s that?</h3>

			<p>Koro-sensei teaches through creativity—turning math into a game, history into a story, and science into an action movie. My professors? They recycle the same lecture notes from ten years ago, sometimes even forgetting to update the date on the title slide. It’s like being taught by a robot programmed in the early 2000s.</p>

			<hr><br>

			<h3>10. Lessons Beyond the Classroom</h3>

			<p>Koro-sensei knows his students — every strength, every weakness, every dream. My professors? I’m not sure they even know what subjects they’re teaching some days. There’s no mutual respect, no effort to understand us as individuals. It’s all about maintaining authority. Koro-sensei would never waste time on ego; he’d focus on building trust and connection.</p>

			<p>Every lesson Koro-sensei teaches feels like a blockbuster event. He makes his students dodge bullets to teach teamwork, or sets up elaborate scenarios to explain moral dilemmas. My professors? The most dramatic thing they’ve done is write “IMPORTANT” in bold red letters on a slide.</p>

			<p>Spoiler: it wasn’t important.</p>

			<h3>## What I’ve Learned?</h3>

			<p>Watching Assassination Classroom was a bittersweet experience. On one hand, it showed me how transformative and exciting education could be. On the other hand, it made me painfully aware of how uninspiring my own college experience often feels.</p>

			<p>Koro-sensei taught me that education isn’t about rigid rules, rote memorization, or mindless obedience. It’s about creativity, connection, and curiosity. He showed me that failure is a stepping stone, not a dead end; that learning can be chaotic, fun, and deeply personal.</p>

			<p>So while I can’t expect my professors to grow tentacles or teach at Mach 20, I can still take these lessons to heart. I can look for inspiration beyond the classroom, embrace failure as part of the process, and—most importantly—remember that learning doesn’t have to be as boring as a PowerPoint slide.</p>

			<p>If Koro-sensei can teach a group of misfit kids to excel while dodging assassination attempts, maybe there’s hope for me too. Or at least hope for a nap during class without getting caught.</p>
