			<p>“Fear of the unknown is the greatest fear of all." Yvon Chouinard.</p>

			<p>Fear is essential for our survival. Fear is rational sometimes—you should be scared of a truck coming your way while crossing the street (unless you want to get isekaid). It can also be irrational, like fear of being without a phone—nomophobia (seriously?). Fear of the unknown is both rational and irrational. You should definitely not wander in a dark forest at night. But talking to an unknown person won’t kill you (perhaps). Junji Ito’s Uzumaki explores the fear of the unknown through the eyes of our protagonists, Kirie and Shuichi, as their fear of spirals turns from an irrational paranoia to a living nightmare.</p>

			<p>Junji Ito’s Uzumaki (Japanese for spiral) manga was published between 1998-99 and has 20 chapters. I would suggest that you read the manga first and then come back. The Uzumaki anime also started airing in October 2024. But it continued the legacy of Ito’s work’s anime adaptation, being a pile of rubbish right after the first episode. Even the storyline of the first episode is all over the place, even if the animation is good. After that, the animation quality plummets to the depths of hell. That being said, let’s venture into the spoiler zone ahead!</p>

			<h3>Story-Driven Narrative of Uzumaki</h3>

			<p>The plot can be propelled in two ways: story and character. In story-driven plots, everything revolves around the story rather than the characters. The characters are just the point of view; they don’t affect the plot much, whereas character-driven plots revolve around the journey of the character(s). The characters are not only our point of view but also the ones driving the story. Uzumaki has a story-driven plot. Throughout the manga/anime, our main characters cannot do anything to stop the horror they face. This feeling of helplessness adds to the horror element. The phenomenon is so large that you are a puny ant in front of it—weak and scared.</p>

			<h3>The Bizzare Nature of Spirals</h3>

			<p>Generally, one would not associate spirals with horror. That’s just a pattern; what can it do to you? This is where the genius of Junji Ito lies. The seemingly harmless spiral turns into a nightmare that swallows an entire town. This is one of the reasons why Uzumaki is the most famous work of Ito sensei, even though his works, like Gyo, Tomie, and Remina, are at the same level (in my opinion). There’s not much you can do with spirals, but Uzumaki has utilized almost every natural instance of spirals, like snails, cochlea, fingerprints, whirlwinds, whirlpools, etc. When Junji Ito exhausted these references, he created his own spirals, like in the mosquito arc, using the flying pattern of mosquitoes or the spiral engulfing Azami Kurotani. The spirals started as small and harmless, like the tiny snail and the pottery in the first chapter. It rapidly escalates till it ends with the final spiral being a mysterious creature. One of the main characteristics of the spiral is that it draws you towards its center. This property is used by Ito a lot during the manga, the best example being that no one is able to leave the town in the end, and the town pulls everyone towards it. This also meant that you can't escape the horror of the spiral no matter what you do; it will always pull you towards it in every case.</p>

			<h3>Uzumaki and the Fear of the Unknown</h3>

			<p>Remember the last time you went to a hospital? If you are like me, then you would feel anxiety in the waiting room. Is it a normal stomachache? Is it a parasite? Is it what Google suggested—cancer? You won't know until the doctor makes the diagnosis. Your condition in the waiting room is unknown to you. It can be anything. It can be something that you can predict or something that you can’t even imagine. This is a typical case of fear of the unknown.</p>

			<p>One of the main inspirations for Junji Ito comes from H.P. Lovecraft’s works. H.P. Lovecraft is such an important person in the horror world that an entire horror genre is named after him—Lovecraftian/cosmic horror. It emphasizes the horror of the unknown and incomprehensible rather than gore and disgust. There’s a famous quote by Sun Tzu: “Know your enemy and know yourself, and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.” Fear naturally comes when encountering something unknown, which is why I hate when authors try to explain the horror body/phenomenon in their works. What’s there to fear when you already know the mechanisms of how things are working? It makes the manga bland and boring.</p>

			<p>Junji Ito rarely ever explains the horror in his manga. This leaves the reader with a question—what exactly happened right there? Right from the start of Uzumaki, we don’t know the cause of the spiral obsession. We just see it happening. Here lies the element of the unknown. As you go through each chapter, the scale of the disaster and the mystery associated with it increases. But even in the end, there was no explanation for what happened in the town. The final spiral creature is the cause of the spiral disaster. But what was it? When was it created? Who or what made it? We simply have no idea.</p>

			<h3>The Major Horror Aspects Throughout the Story</h3>\

			<p>The first person that was affected by the spiral was Shuichi’s father. He did many unsettling things, like rotating his eyeballs, rolling his tongue, and finally stuffing himself in a circular box, making a spiral with his body in his pursuit of the spiral. That’s when we know that things are getting out of hand. We know that normal humans can’t do the stuff he did. How did he do it? I am just as clueless as I am during my exams.</p>

			<p>Shuichi’s mother started seeing her husband in every spiral around her. At the end of the chapter, the spiral speaks to her and tells her about the spiral in her ears. Do spirals speak? No. Did she previously know about the cochlea in the ear? No. Then how did she conclude and become so sure she pierced her ear with scissors?</p>

			<p>Azami Kurotani’s scar turns into a spiral, engulfing her and another boy. Kirie’s and her classmate’s hair curls into spirals and drains the life of the classmate, killing her. The jack-in-the-box boy rises from the dead. People transform into snails, and other people cook and eat the snails. The lighthouse emits mystical rays. The storm targets Kirie, almost killing her. A row house contains a peculiar disease. Whirlwinds occur from the smallest of movements. Whirlpools swallow rescue ships. People twist and entangle in row houses. The speed of time changes around Kurouzo-cho. The row houses all align themselves in the shape of a spiral.</p>

			<p>The reasons for all these events are unknown. No matter how much you rack your brains, the only common thing is the spiral pattern. Each event is unique in other aspects. You can’t predict what’s going to happen based on previous events. Fear of the unknown strikes again.</p>

			<p>I think you’ve noticed that I skipped the hospital arc in the above explanation. So, let’s discuss my favorite arc!</p>

			<h3>The Hospital Arc</h3>

			<p>This arc is about vampiric pregnant women who behave like mosquitoes; they drink blood to nourish their babies! For some unknown reason, the babies are born normal, even healthier than normal children. However, the cuteness of the babies can’t deceive Kirie. She heard them talking about returning to their mother’s womb. Following this, she bears witness to the horror of the children’s wishes.</p>

			<p>This arc contains some of the most bone-chilling illustrations I’ve ever seen. The way Ito involved the spiral here is also unorthodox. He shows the mosquitoes flying in a spiral pattern that hypnotizes a person. No other type of spiral is seen here. This was the weirdest part of a weird story. Why were there so many pregnant women at once? Why were they bloodthirsty? Why does consuming blood lead to women having such exceptionally healthy babies? What kind of babies talk? Mushroom from the placenta? Babies with homesickness? Ito sensei used his creativity to the fullest in this arc. I don't think that anyone would be wary of pregnant women. When the ones that are supposed to be cared for turn into monsters, now that would scare me.</p>

			<p>Our emotion of fear can be dated back to the reptilian brains. That’s why fear is so fundamental to us. In the manga medium, the one who can best evoke this emotion is undoubtedly Junji Ito. Uzumaki is popular for a reason; the story, the characters, the setting, and the art were all superb. Uzumaki incorporates the idea of fear of the unknown uniquely and bizarrely. If you are new to manga or even horror, Uzumaki is a must-read! Experience the timeless classic that warps your perception of the abundant and mesmerizing shape-spirals.
