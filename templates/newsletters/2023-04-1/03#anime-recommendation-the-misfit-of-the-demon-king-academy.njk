			<p>Everyone goes to school with expectations, some for friendship, some for learning, some for romance, etc. But if these are all for normal schools, then what is your expectation when you enrol in a 'Demon King' academy, where students are taught to become the next demon king? Moreover, when you are their ancestor, the Demon King, now hold your breath and let us dive into the fantasy world of the anime 'The Misfit of Demon King Academy: History's Strongest Demon King Reincarnates and Goes to School with His Descendant', in short 'The Misfit of Demon King Academy'.</p>

            <p>The story starts as Anos Voldigoad, the demon king, sacrifices his life and makes a deal with the hero, Kanon, to create a barrier between the human and demon worlds to put an end to the long-standing demon-human war, but it was the start of his new journey as he reincarnates as a hybrid demon in the demon world after a long 2000 years. The world has changed, and as time goes on, he finds out that the so-called pure-blood demons see themselves as superior and the hybrids as inferior and oppress them. A hierarchy has been established. Not only is the peace for which he sacrificed his life just a superficial fa√ßade created by a false demon king who has erased the history of his existence, but he also finds out that the magic powers of the demons have been depleted to a great extent. Now he sets out on his journey to correct the things that went wrong, starting by enrolling in the Demon King Academy as a "misfit", a title that is given to hybrid demons.</p>
            <p>The story may be fantasy-based, like magic, demons, etc., but it also focuses on the school life of the former 'Demon King', like how he makes friends, enjoys his school life, tries to protect his friends and family from the dangers in and outside of the academy, etc.; it also has drama, action, a little mystery like secret opponents, etc. It has a unique story that revolves around a demon king, who is referred to as a great villain in any typical anime story, and shows that the demons have their own stories to tell. It contains the value of life and family. It also shows using the power in a positive way. The MC is an overpowered character with a harem who is much more powerful than his enemies can imagine. But it is not boring because of this, as the hero is also an OP character. It also has elements like magic fights between students and schools. It has consistent and moderately high-quality animation, and the art is satisfying with its own charisma. If you like OP-MC with lots of girls or magic school anime with magic battles, then it is a good choice for you to watch.</p>
