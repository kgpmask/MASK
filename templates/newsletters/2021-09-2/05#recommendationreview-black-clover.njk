			<h3>MyAnimeList Synopsis</h3>
			<p>Asta and Yuno were abandoned at the same church on the same day. Raised together as children, they came to know of the “Wizard King”—a title given to the strongest mage in the kingdom—and promised that they would compete against each other for the position of the next Wizard King. However, as they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield magic with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers by training physically.</p>
			<p>When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is bestowed a spectacular Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while Asta receives nothing. However, soon after, Yuno is attacked by a person named Lebuty, whose goal is to steal Yuno’s Grimoire. Asta tries to fight Lebuty, but he is outmatched. Though without hope and on the brink of defeat, he finds the strength to continue when he hears Yuno’s voice. Unleashing his inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a “Black Clover” giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty. A few days later, the two friends head out into the world, both seeking the same goal - to become the Wizard King!</p>

			<p>Black Clover has a simplistic yet complex story that draws us in and makes us invested in the world that the anime has created. The anime at some point becomes predictable but still it doesn't fail to give you chills. It’s amazing how much the author has accomplished when he just started the story with two kids with the same dream to become the wizard king. Besides the protagonists, the author has been successfully able to create an expansive, developed and fleshed out world, with different kingdoms and classes of operatives, the kingdoms fighting each other and the clover kingdom having nine different squads of magic knights protecting the kingdom.</p>
			<p>This anime also has an insane character development where each individual character is given a good amount of detail and attention, the side characters have got their back story explained with everyone of them having a proper character development, creating a sense that the show isn’t just about one or two people, which only adds to the world building. Our lead Asta has a clear-cut goal, to never give up and become the wizard king. The show doesn’t let us forget that, or that Yuno is the same, both Yuno and Asta have very contrasting characteristics where Asta being loud, noisy, friendly and dumb and Yuno being quite, smart and way cooler attitude. Still no matter where they are or how different they are, the other is still their rival and best friend/brother. This anime is filled with characters making motivational statements where one of my favourites is Captain Fuegoleon Vermillion stating “being weak is nothing to be ashamed of… staying weak is” which clearly motivates the watchers to overcome their challenges and difficulties in real life.</p>

			<p>The animation and art of this anime is quite good at non-action scenes, but it disappoints a little at action scenes. The animation should have been better as expected from a new generation anime, though the animation quality is improving day by day. The latest released episodes have quite good animation compared to its initial episodes’ fight scenes.</p>
			<p>Now comes one of the best parts - the music and the OST. Black Clover has one of the best opening songs of all time where every opening is a banger. 13 openings have been released so far, and all of them are excellent. The most popular opening among the fans is currently the opening #10 (Vickeblanka - Black Catcher). One of the qualities of its openings is that it tries to give you very little spoilers of the anime, unlike other anime which spoil some scenes of their arcs in the openings. To make things even more enjoyable, Black Clover has multiple versions of the same opening. The version of opening changes after some episodes, by adding new major scenes from the previous episodes, so that viewers won't get spoiled. The OST playing during the fight scenes completely syncs with the action and lets you experience the emotions of the characters during the scene.</p>
			<p>I would like to end by saying that Black Clover is a thoroughly fun show to watch with a simple story. The show as whole gets you hooked up and refuses to let you go. You will find yourself laughing, smiling and getting shivers throughout the show - and enjoying the excitement.</p>
