			<p>This is a classic that is almost certainly going to come up while discussing romance anime. This show offers far more than the latest clich√© rom-com, replete with needless stereotypes, and has an amnesiac protagonist who is plagued by his past self and becomes involved in a love triangle with both his present crush and his prior love interest. It is not as sweet an anime as Tonikawa or Horimiya, but instead a proper and deeply impressive show with much more dimensions.</p>
