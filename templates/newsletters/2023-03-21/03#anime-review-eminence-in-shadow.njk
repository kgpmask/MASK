            <p>Eminence in Shadow. What is this anime? Why has it been the talk of the community in recent seasons? Should you watch it? What are its selling points? We see half a dozen isekai anime every season. So what makes it stand out so much? This review is all about what makes Eminence in Shadow one of the most exciting and popular isekai anime in recent years, and what you can expect from it.</p>
            <p>Fall 2022 featured a few of the biggest debut series like The Chainsaw Man and Blue Lock as well as sequels like BNHA S6, Bleach TYBW, Mob Psycho III, To Your Eternity S2 and Spy x Family S2. For anime fans, this was arguably the best season in a long time, but for a not so known, not so anticipated anime series, it could only be an uphill climb. It is very likely that a show does not get the recognition and popularity it deserved because of the presence of such juggernauts. But Eminence in Shadow not only climbed the hill, it thoroughly smashed the charts, becoming the 3rd most popular debut anime, and the 7th most popular seasonal anime of the season, surpassing Bocchi The Rock and trailing marginally behind Bleach TYBW.</p>
            <p>Isekai anime. A character from modern Japan gets hit by truck-kun (or dies another way) and gets reborn in a fantasy world of swords and magic. Isn&rsquo;t this the 46th time I am hearing this setting? NO. I&rsquo;ve heard it far more times. Is Eminence in Shadow bring something unique with depth to the plot like Mushoku Tensei? NO. This anime is the spitting image of a seasonal generic trash isekai show which has a significantly better animation to offer. Is it something special that holds significance in the history of isekai anime, like SAO or Mushoku Tensei? This anime can&rsquo;t be any further away from that. But is that all? Yes, and no. Confused? Let me explain in detail.</p>
            <p>Kids like action and fantasy shows like Power Rangers. They like the protagonist of the show who plays the hero and saves the day. Some kids who go against the flow might even like the villains, but our protagonist, Kageno Minoru (Cid Kagenou after getting isekai&rsquo;d) idolizes the powers in the shadow. The elusive power that no one knows about, yet which holds the power and ability to control the society from behind the scenes (I am not talking about bureaucracy). Unlike the other kids who grow out of this phase, Minoru doesn&rsquo;t give up on his dream and trains to become the true eminence in shadow, all the while knowing that it is just not possible. What do we get when someone with such commitment to his dream is given magic? I&rsquo;ll leave it up to you to find out.</p>
            <p>This anime is another take on an overused concept; OP protagonist in a fantasy world who can accomplish whatever he wants with ease. This narrows down the list of similar anime to about half. The protagonist is apathetic? Nothing new there. Does the protagonist hide his strength? Again, a more than common occurrence. Does mixing all this gives us something fantastic? Well, maybe, but that alone does not do justice to the brilliance of this show (Overlord crying in the background). This anime took the fantasies of a teenage boy, mixed everything that could be compatible with it, and escalated it to unreal proportions. Cringe and cool are two faces of the same coin. When things become too edgy, they become cringe. But what happens when you keep on compounding that edginess until there can&rsquo;t be anymore? You get 20 episodes packed with hype, stupid dialogues that sound cooler than Plus Ultra and pure enjoyment.</p>
            <p>Kagenou can go to any verse and solo the entire verse there, even Dragon Ball, just because this guy doesn&rsquo;t know to lose. He thrashes beings with the capabilities to ruin nations and thinks they are &lsquo;slightly strong bandits&rsquo;. When he thinks that any more fighting will end the battle, he destroys the entire region while speaking Latin and leaves. Meanwhile, his mob character persona pulls all the stops to become a background character. Getting beaten black and blue? Think more. Torture? Not there yet. Death? Now that level of mobness sounds perfect for a mob character. This guy has a shadow empire operating under him with hundreds of members that has the strength to topple a nation within a day WITHOUT A SINGLE GUY, and he thinks that they are just fooling around for his sake to make his roleplay look more real. This anime doesn&rsquo;t have a single plot armor, because the armor is the entire plot. Kagenou doesn&rsquo;t have good luck; he has so much luck that he blesses lady luck. He is never in danger; he is the danger. He sends the concept of planning and deliberation into existential crises. He is the one who knocks!</p>
            <p>Leaving the being an eminence in the shadow part apart, this anime has one of the richest and well-choreographed fight sequences you&rsquo;ll see in a seasonal anime. This anime has more action than Black Clover has in an average episode, and it conveys more plot than an average isekai anime covers in a single episode. Unlike other seasonal anime that rips content from manga to fit 3 arcs in a single season, Eminence in Shadow conveys the plot in much more immersion than the manga itself, staying closer to the light novel source, while also covering 5 arcs in the span of 20 episodes. The power scaling leaves nothing to complain about, the OST is way too good for a seasonal show, and Studio Nexus again presented us with a master-class animation and sound-scene syncs after 7 whole years. Every frame of every fight sequence of every episode is made without any regard to the budget. Beating the enemy with a sneeze? Okay, we&rsquo;ll thoroughly draw every frame of that as well. The opening theme gives one a good taste of Japanese rock music, while also showing an entirely new concept of the characters. As for the ending theme, I am certain most of you will not skip it for any episode because….ahem… let&rsquo;s not go there. There are some good instances of comedy. The 2 mob buds of Kagenou have names Skel Eton and Po Tato, mobbing the mob out of the mobs. This anime is the complete package of what a 13-year-old would dream of and you’ll know it from the moment you get into this anime, yet you will not be able to stop yourself from wanting more of this crap.</p>
            <p>This anime might very well become a thing of the past 5 years from now, but what it achieved might leave a mark in the history of isekai anime. This anime showed me that you do not necessarily need to have something exceptional or unique to stand out, but you can be exceptional in what you know to do to stand out. This anime will not enter your top 10% list, but while you watch it, it might possibly steal the top spot in the list for the duration.</p>
