Once they arrived in the world of the characters, they interviewed them and learn more about their lives and their stories. The team was able to interview various characters, including Luffy, Tanjiro, Ash & Pikachu, another Luffy, Naruto, Levi, yet another Luffy and many others. The interviews were a great way for fans of anime and manga to learn more about their favourite characters and to get a glimpse into their lives.
