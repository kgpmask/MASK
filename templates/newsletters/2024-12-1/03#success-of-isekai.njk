			<h3>Contemporary state of Isekai</h3>
			<p>Isekai has been quite a bore these days with all the routine settings and titles. I mean, who puts these absurdly long cliche titles like “That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime”, “Campfire Cooking in Another World with my Absurd Skill”, and “My Instant Death Ability is Overpowered”?</p>

			<p>But is that to say that Isekai has no hope of innovation? Can nothing be made to make Isekai great? Well, Isekai does have quite the gems like Re: Zero, Mushoku Tensei, and Konosuba, for starters. Among these, don’t you think one has quite the different vibes?</p>

			<p>The odd one here is Konosuba, which has happy and cheerful vibes. But is that all that makes it odd? No, far from it.</p>

			<p>But before we start our discussion, let’s clarify that we will be using the shorthand “Konosuba” to refer to the anime <b>“KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!”/“Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!”</b></p>

			<h3>Other Isekai Anime are clichéd</h3>

			<p>Almost all isekai anime are bound to have one of the following features: overpowered MC, depressing setting, detailed world-building, or an absurd idea around which the story revolves. Any standard isekai with “I reincarnated” in its title either has an overpowered MC or MC has incarnated as a weird object. <i>Yes, I am looking at you, Vending Machine Kun.</i></p>

			<p>The absurdly long titles of isekai make it the butt of many jokes. To make matters worse, the title of an isekai often acts like a clickbait. The title “The World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat.” makes the anime look like a “what-if” video without much content and originality.</p>

			<p>Overpowered MC is a double-edged sword. If done correctly, the anime becomes severely enjoyable. Otherwise, it goes down the drain. Anime like Eminence in Shadow, Overlord and Tensura (slime isekai) are hailed as successes, while anime like “Chillin' in Another World with Level 2 Super Cheat Powers” are considered bad.</p>

			<p>The archetype of “Reincarnated as ____” often allows otakus to enjoy fun what-if scenarios. But most of them unfortunately fail due to adaptation limitations or the limitations provided by the original concept itself. Any anime that focuses on the consequences of a peculiar reincarnation will hit its limit after a few episodes. Nonetheless, the anime that are successful in this category are the ones that can fully utilize the potential offered by the what-ifs and conclude the series before it gets boring. For example, “Devil is a Part-Timer” is a fun anime to watch due to the character interactions and the lessons learned by Maou Sama in his day-to-day life in Japan. While the concept wasn’t so special, the anime fully executed the limited potential.</p>

			<h3>Konosuba is a satire on isekai</h3>

			<p>What makes Konosuba so special is that it was meant to be a satire on the isekai genre from the very beginning.</p>

			<p>The comedic death of the protagonist, Kazuma Satou, who dies from shock after thinking a truck will hit him when it was just a slow tractor, is a satire of the common trope of Truck-Kun or murdered killing the protagonists.</p>

			<p>While many isekai stories start with the MC getting an overpowered weapon or ability from the gods or an overpowered and comically reliable companion in the beginning, Konosuba starts with a useless goddess and proceeds with the addition of quirky companions in the hero’s party. [A personal opinion here: I would take goddess Aqua, my beloved, over any weapon or ability. ]</p>

			<p>While average isekai MCs get hell-bent on defeating the demon lord after a few personal encounters with their tyrannical rule, Kazuma always tries to escape the whole “killing the devil” drama and stay comfy. And yet, Kazuma always helps the town or his friends in any trouble they face, no matter how irritated he acts from the whole ordeal, <s>making him a cute tsundere/cutie patootie.</s></p>

			<h3>Konosuba follows and disobeys many tropes</h3>

			<p>Konosuba is subject to many tropes but disobeys many tropes, too. All isekai these days have lolicons, and Konosuba is no different. Konosuba also follows a game-derived world with the adventurers guild system.</p>

			<p>p.s. This is THE smallest section of the article.</p>

			<h3>Konosuba has comedy</h3>

			<p>The more you look at it, the more you realise Konosuba is more of a comedy than an isekai. The show is so comedic that it's so easy to forget it’s an isekai. Kazuma and the gang blending into the city of beginnings is one of the smoothest progressions I have ever seen.</p>

			<p>The mischief Aqua causes to trouble the townsfolk ultimately falls on Kazuma to solve, while Aqua is clueless that she caused the issue in the first place. Aqua steadily learning party tricks and gaining popularity as the “Goddess of party tricks” was an enjoyable journey. At the same time, her interactions with Kazuma, who has long forsaken the image of a woman or goddess in her, are incredibly funny. That one time when Aqua hits Kazuma with wads of cash as they talk like money-grubbing fools in the early morning is probably my favourite. Aqua, her alcohol, and Kazuma are a really funny trio (to bully Aqua); simultaneously, it is rivalled by another trio of comedy, namely, Aqua, her tea purified as water, and Kazuma.</p>

			<p>Megumin and her obsession with explosions became a pain in the arse for the surrounding people in the beginning. Still, we see that after a decent amount of time, the townspeople accepted it as natural, like rain, gusts, and storms. But from time to time, visitors and enemies of the city alike are surprised to see the power of those explosions.</p>

			<p>Darkness’ masochism being mistaken for chivalry in the early days and villains getting disgusted by her perviness was some humour. The series also gave 101 on how to use a Masochist in your party with Darkness as the textbook, which might be useful to many anime characters.</p>

			<p>Wiz is a classic kind-mom type character, but Vanir, the Duke of Hell, comes to balance her. The adventurer’s guild lady, Luna, and the bearded regular of the guild provide the necessary narration and speak on behalf of the audience. Goddess Eris, being the goddess she is, treats everyone well but turns into a comedy piece when Aqua shows her senpai side.</p>

			<p>With characters like these, we frequently see wonderful examples of Boke and Tsukkomi routine in the show. What’s Boke and Tsukkomi routine? It’s a piece of comedy centring around a “funny man” who makes non-sensical or light routines and the “straight guy” who corrects the funny man being the voice of reason. I hope the following image helps.</p>

			<p>Here, Luffy is the “boke” and the zombie who retorts “Like I’d go back you fool!” and the crew who scolds Luffy “It’s a Zombie!” are the “tsukkomi”.</p>

			<h3>Konosuba never gets serious.</h3>

			<p>One of the things that makes Konosuba special is its ability to stay free from dead serious moments at almost all times. Even in the face of the villain from the demon king’s army, the masochistic tendencies of Darkness don’t falter, neither do Kazuma’s retort as a tsukkomi nor Megumin’s explosion mania. That’s another thing that makes Konosuba special. It’s always on a fun and aloof tone. When it does get serious, like during the attack on Axis Cult, we see a different side of the characters, bringing depth to the gravity of the situation. When Konosuba is serious, it feels more serious than usual because it’s rare. Aqua working hard for her devouts really touched my heart, especially right after they rejected her as their goddess.</p>

			<p>At the same time, Konosuba being funny, even in serious moments, greatly relieves the viewers. Moments like Darkness enjoying Vanir taking over her, Kazuma calling Darkness as Lalatina to clear the air, Megumin making Kazuma resurrect by writing weird stuff on his body when he is dead, a villain trying to destroy a cult after annoyance of their soap advertisement, and many more similar instances showcase this well.</p>

			<h3>Konosuba is also a slice of life</h3>

			<p>In the contemporary world, where serious moments stress us out, we all need that slice of life or romance anime to get away from this world and have a small rest. But… even the slice of life happens in our own world, right? Wouldn’t it be more satisfactory if we removed that one connection and left our world out? Doesn’t that sound like a combination of Isekai and SOL? Isn’t that what those reincarnated as ___ anime seem to be doing?</p>

			<p>I don’t know where the other shows went wrong, but I can say that Konosuba is a good slice of life. With such a comfy world, amazing characters and their soothing dynamics, it’s hard to remember which world we live in.</p>

			<p>Even in general, most isekai have a world that mesmerises the audience and makes them want to enter that world. However, with the stressless nature of Konosuba, the attraction has increased even more. Wiz’s shop, adventurers guild, and Kazuma’s mansion all seem like fun places to be too.</p>

			<p>The first episode of Konosuba, where Aqua and Kazuma work with the day labourers to earn money and bond with others during the work, has been etched into my mind as one of the best slice-of-life moments. And though there are better moments in various other anime, this one takes my bias for being in my early anime days.</p>

			<p>The first two openings and endings of Konosuba are simply out of this world. They are the major reason I associate Konosuba with the slice-of-life genre. The EDs “Chiisana Boukensha” and “Ouchi Ni Kaeritai”, which translate to "Little Adventurer" and "I Wanna Go Home," are simply divine. Listening to them makes you feel like a true "little adventurer," with the second song evoking the sense of an adventurer feeling homesick. If you have a campfire with your friends at any point in life, try to listen to these songs in front of the campfire. The two OPs, on the other hand, show the fun and chaotic nature surrounding Kazuma and the party. Its vibe is enough to brighten your day.</p>

			<h3>Konosuba is a successful adaptation</h3>

			<p>“Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!” aka Konosuba, is a Japanese light novel series written by Natsume Akatsuki and illustrated by Kurone Mishima. Its English title is “KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!”. </p>

			<p>Serialised initially as a web novel on Shōsetsuka ni Narō between December 2012 and October 2013, KonoSuba was published as a printed light novel series by Kadokawa Shoten from October 2013 to May 2020. The plots for LN and WN are different.</p>

			<p>A manga adaptation, illustrated by Masahito Watari and Joseph Yokobori, began serialisation in October 2014. With Manga currently behind the anime.</p>

			<p>Konosuba has several spin-off series, with one in particular, “KonoSuba: An Explosion on This Wonderful World!” containing important plot points related to the main series. Others are “KonoSuba: Consulting With This Masked Devil!” and “KonoSuba: Extra Attention to that Wonderful Fool!”. The latter two are adapted into manga as well.</p>

			<p>Konosuba also has the film “KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! Legend of Crimson” apart from its anime series.</p>

			<p>Konosuba is part of a crossover series called Isekai Quarter, which is a really one-of-a-kind crossover of 4 between the light novel-based series KonoSuba, Overlord, Re:Zero, and The Saga of Tanya the Evil, all published by Kadokawa Corporation. The crossover show has 2 seasons and an anime.</p>

			<p>With an LN, WN, manga, anime, 3 side series in LN, 2 side series adapted into manga, and 1 side series adapted into anime, Konosuba stands proud as one having tremendous success in the industry. After all, gathering enough attention to have these many works under the same title is no small feat.</p>

			<h3>God’s Blessing on This Wonderful World</h3>

			<p>For me, Konosuba was one of the happiest things to have happened. Ironically enough, I watched a satire on isekai as my first isekai. Nevertheless, I was fortunate to have been introduced to this fun-filled show by a friend who showed me its satirical beauty in the recommendation itself. Konosuba will always have a special place in my heart for bringing a smile to my face despite the chaos surrounding me at the time.</p>

			<p>With its cheery, loafing, comfy and happy nature, with this wonderful ability to trigger positive emotions in the audience, it has truly earned itself the title, at least in my opinion, of “God’s Blessing on This Wonderful World”.</p>

			<p>If you had watched Konosuba, hope this article rekindled some memories. If you haven’t watched Konosuba, hope this article was enough motivation to start it.</p>

			<br/><p>TL;DR Overall, watching Konosuba was a very happy experience for me. Hence, I would say it’s successful, and I recommend watching it. In the show’s words, this show is truly a “God’s Blessing on This Wonderful World”. Well finally,</p>
