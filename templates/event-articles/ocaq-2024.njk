	<h2> Motivation for the event: </h2>
	<p> Following the resounding success of MASK's Open Campus Anime Quiz in the past couple of years, our team wasted no time gearing up for this yearâ€™s edition. At the start of the semester, we enthusiastically dived into creating engaging quiz questions and planning captivating performances. </p>

	<h2> Conduction: </h2>
	<p> On August 18th, 2024, the highly anticipated day arrived, and V-3 Vikramshila became the venue for our lively event. Students came in high spirits, and the air was filled with anticipation. Our hosts, Nayandeep (Markio) and Anamika, kicked things off with great energy, setting the tone for the evening and giving some insights about MASK. </p>

	<p> Meanwhile, quizmasters Binaya (BNY) and Rishabh (HRD) started Round 1 with easy questions to help everyone understand OCAQ. The questions covered various topics, from general knowledge to pop culture, engaging the participants immediately. Later, Round 2 featured a video round, allowing the audience to relive the nostalgia of popular anime and engaging them with fascinating questions. The videos were carefully selected to provide entertainment and challenge, keeping the audience on the edge. Their humorous banter made the first few rounds a hit, creating a lively and engaging atmosphere. </p>

	<p> Soon after, Shehryaar and Rishith took over, guiding participants through the 3rd round, which was image-based, showcasing cool and weird character images. The round tested the participants' knowledge and sparked discussions and excitement as they tried to identify the characters and their significance. Then, Round 4 began with a theme of audio-based questions, capturing everyone's attention with a mix of sound clips and music excerpts. The round challenged the participants' auditory skills and added an interactive element to the event. </p>
