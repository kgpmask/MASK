			<h3>Introduction:</h3>

			<p>You’re a huge otaku eh? Think you’ve seen it all? Nah, you have just been stuck in the mainstream world. While the mainstream giants always hog the spotlight, there’s a whole world of underrated anime quietly flexing their brilliance in the shadows. These shows might not have the flashiest protagonists or get meme-d a lot, but trust me, they will make you wish you had found them sooner. So, here are five underrated anime that everyone should definitely watch.</p>

			<h3>Astra Lost in Space:</h3>

			<p>If you’re looking for an anime that throws high schoolers into space and leaves you wondering, “What just happened?” every five minutes, then “Astra Lost in Space” is the one for you. Imagine waking up one day, ready for a boring school camping trip, only to be yeeted 5000 light years from home with a bunch of strangers. Just pure chaos and a whole lot of “Okay, we are screwed.”</p>

			<p>These students try to survive with limited supplies and mediocre survival skills. They navigate through the most obscure planets you couldn't have imagined, even in your wildest dreams. And the romantic side plot just makes this a hundred times better! Despite all the craziness, what really makes this show worth watching is its emotional depth. You’ll laugh, cry, and question how these kids are handling the stress way better than how you handle waking up in the morning. So definitely give this show a watch, and I can promise you that this is a journey you won't regret taking and something that will stay in your heart forever.</p>

			<h3>The Royal Tutor:</h3>

			<br/><center><img src="/assets/releases/2024-12-1/4-2.webp" alt="." style="width: calc(min(500px, 45vw))"></center><br/>

			<p>Imagine a teacher being so good at their job that they could probably convince someone that the earth is actually flat. “Heine Wittgenstein” is a born genius who looks like he cannot be allowed to ride an attraction in the amusement park, and most definitely not like someone who can be left to handle an entire kingdom’s education system. Well, how the turntables because he can do both.</p>

			<p>He is a two-foot-tall royal tutor who raises the kingdom's princes to be good future rulers. But he is not any ordinary tutor. One moment, he’s giving life lessons like Mahatma Gandhi and the next, he’s having a roast session that leaves the princes questioning all their life choices. And then about the princes - there’s the studious one, the tsundere, the shy one, and the flirty one.</p>

			<p>So, if you’re in the mood for a show that’s equal parts laughs, life lessons, and unexpected wholesomeness, “The Royal Tutor” is the perfect pick. </p>

			<h3>Migi and Dali:</h3>

			<br/><center><img src="/assets/releases/2024-12-1/4-3.webp" alt="." style="width: calc(min(500px, 45vw))"></center><br/>

			<p>This story is about a set of twins, “Migi” and “Dali”, who one day go, “You know what? Let’s pretend to be ONE person because our adoptive parents only want a single child.” But the dumb parents don’t even suspect anything, even though they are both clearly mirror images of each other. And yes, this anime has an actual plot where the twins try to find the identity of the murderer who killed their biological mother. Even though this is the dumbest set of twins you will ever come across, they somehow manage not to get caught by their parents. And what if their plans fall apart? They manage it with the most ridiculous excuses and last-minute scrambling. These scenes will have you rolling on the floor with laughter and screaming, “How are they still getting away with this?”</p>

			<p>So, if you are in the mood for some fun but also serious case-solving, this is the show you must binge.</p>

			<h3>Plastic Memories:</h3>

			<br/><center><img src="/assets/releases/2024-12-1/4-4.webp" alt="." style="width: calc(min(500px, 45vw))"></center><br/>

			<p>“Plastic Memories” is a sci-fi love story set in a world where humans live alongside robots called “giftias”. But the sad part is that these giftias have a painfully short lifetime, and their memories are wiped out once their lifetime is over, leaving behind an empty shell. In other words, viewers with hearts are strongly advised to stay away (unless you’re ready to have it shattered into a million pieces). In this story, the protagonist falls in love with a giftia but is unaware that her lifespan is ending very soon. They both genuinely enjoy their time together, and even the giftia learns what “love” is. But they do have to say goodbye. Goodbyes are indeed heartbreaking, but as Dr Seuss said, "Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened." And this anime taught me an important lesson. Relationships are always worth cherishing, no matter how fleeting or short they are. </p>

			<p>Do not sleep on this anime. This is an absolute tearjerker that will leave your heart in pieces. Each moment is so beautifully crafted that you will find yourself cherishing the experience despite the heartbreak.</p>

			<h3>Kiznaiver:</h3>

			<br/><center><img src="/assets/releases/2024-12-1/4-5.webp" alt="." style="width: calc(min(500px, 45vw))"></center><br/>

			<p>To describe this anime in simpler words, it’s a group of high school students who share each other’s pain. Not metaphorically, but literally. This anime takes place in a city called “Sugomori”, and a group of teenagers were forcefully turned into test subjects for the “Kizna System”. It is a scientific experiment that links physical and emotional pain. Now, as this group starts getting along well with each other, things get messy. Imagine having to share your every embarrassing moment, every insecurity and every awkward crush with people you barely know. It's very hilarious and painful. And that’s how Kiznaiver is. But behind all this chaos, the story's central theme is about understanding who we are- how even our flaws are a part of us.</p>

			<p>Please give Kiznaiver a shot. It’s one of those shows that hits you hard, showing you just how messy and beautiful human connections can be. With its unique twist and deep emotional moments, it’ll have you thinking about the true meaning of friendship.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

			<p>To wrap it all up, I recommend stepping out of your comfort zone and giving these underrated gems a chance. For they will leave a lasting impression, and some might even become your new favourites. After all, the most unforgettable journeys always lie on the path less trodden by.</p>
