			<p>In the vast world of horror anime, the most terrifying ones need not always involve carnage, mythical beings, or grotesque monsters. The most horrifying horror is undoubtedly - the horror of backstabbing. This sword called betrayal cuts deeper than any weapon, leaving one questioning whether even the bond they hold close to their heart is true because the most devastating thing a soul can experience is when the person they trusted so much explicitly turns against them.</p>

			<p>In this article, we will look into two masterpieces - “The Promised Neverland” and “Summertime Rendering”, where each plot twist pulls you deeper into a world of suspense, horror and mystery.</p>

			<h3>Summertime Rendering:</h3><br>

			<p>Summertime Rendering is one of the best anime published in 2022 for its remarkable story and a cherry on top ending. This show is mainly renowned for one thing - “not screwing up a perfectly good story”, which a lot of anime tend to do. There is no sense of lingering regrets or wasted potential, which makes this anime a satisfying watch. Most horror anime use intensely grotesque scenes and bloodshed to deeply engrave terror in the viewers' hearts. However, that is not the case with this one. Although there are some unpleasant scenes, it is cute for the most part.</p><br>

			<p>It also stands out for its unique take on the horror genre, which is what we will delve deeper into. In this story, the protagonist, Ajiro Junpei, returns to his hometown after several years for the funeral of his childhood best friend, whose death is entangled in a complex web of mysteries. As we progress into the story, the concept of “betrayal” becomes more apparent and vital. The main culprits of this show are the “Shadows”. The “Shadows” in the story can take on any form, which makes the character always be at an edge, constantly doubting every action of everyone dear to them. The feeling that anyone around you could be a “Shadow” always gives you discomfort, which turns trust into an ultimate gamble.</p>
			
			<p>The narrative of this story is elevated even more by introducing a "loop by death" concept, where the protagonist goes back in time every time he dies. Upon his death, he is sent back to the past, allowing him to relive the events leading up to his death with full knowledge of what has happened. With every loop, the stakes become higher, and his understanding of reality begins to blur. This concept further complicates his understanding of reality and trust as he constantly keeps second-guessing what is real and who can be trusted, making the presence of "Shadows" even more menacing and their betrayal more impactful.</p>

			<h3>Promised Neverland:</h3><br>
			<center><img src="/assets/releases/2024-10-1/5-4.webp" alt="." style="width: calc(min(480px, 40vw));"></center><br>

			<p>This anime is notorious for one thing - screwing up the second season. The first season was so memorable and had so much potential which ultimately was thrown into garbage without hesitation. Setting that aside and while talking solely about the first season, it stands as one of the greatest horror anime ever created to date. This anime is more of a psychological horror, and “Backstabbing and Betrayal” plays an important role</p>
             
			<p>The “Grace Field House” is a paradise for the orphans residing there. It is a place filled with joy and warmth. The children get everything they want - food, education, and affection. The mama, Isabella, plays the role of the mom who loves everyone and is also loved by everyone. But this “Grace Field House” is definitely not what it seems like on the outside. The truth is much more haunting, and one cannot even imagine what is happening there.</p>

			<p>The horrifying truth of this orphanage is that it is a farm where young children are raised like mere livestock to feed demons. But the children are completely unaware of this and have been made to believe for multiple years that they are instead being protected and cared for by the mama, Isabella. But the true face of this loving mother is a well-oiled machine of deception.</p><br>

			<p>This deception extends beyond Isabella to the whole institution that nurtures multiple farms like the Grace Field House, which different mamas take care of. The psychological horror of this anime is the agonising weight of the realisation that the children were never safe from the start. Every act of care and kindness was calculated to ensure that no doubt arose among the children. The crushing weight of this betrayal, combined with the feeling of realisation that they were living in a fake utopia all along, is suffocating. And this scar remained even long after the children found the truth.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
			
			<p>In conclusion, considering “Summertime Rendering” and “The Promised Neverland”, it is clear that the most agonising horror isn't about the monster under your bed but the terror of betrayal from those you hold dear. Ultimately, whether it comes to shape-shifting shadows or the betrayal of a cookie jar filled with a sewing kit instead of cookies, the real horror might be none other than living in a world without anime.</p>
