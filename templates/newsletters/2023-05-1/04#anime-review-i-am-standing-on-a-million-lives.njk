			<p>&ldquo;I am Standing on a million lives&rdquo; is a captivating anime that combines fantasy, adventure, and strategic gameplay elements. The story revolves around Yotsuya, an ordinary high school student unexpectedly transported into a fantasy world with his classmates Shindo and Hakozaki. In this new world, they are tasked with completing quests and fighting various monsters to save the lives of real people back in their world.</p>
			<p>"I am Standing on a million lives" is a captivating anime that combines fantasy, adventure, and strategic gameplay elements. The story revolves around Yotsuya, an ordinary high school student unexpectedly transported into a fantasy world with his classmates Shindo and Hakozaki. In this new world, they are tasked with completing quests and fighting various monsters to save the lives of real people back in their world.</p>
			<p>One of the standout aspects of &ldquo;I am standing on a million lives&rdquo; is its character development. All of the main cast goes through significant character development. Their relationships deepen and evolve, creating emotional investment for the viewers. </p>
			<p>This anime doesn&rsquo;t follow the typical isekai/fantasy anime theme of making the main characters incredibly stronger. That&rsquo;s why it doesn&rsquo;t involve any flashy fights. Instead, you will see the characters struggling, which is enough to keep you on edge. Despite that, the animation is very satisfactory. The world created is very beautiful. </p>
			<p>However, the anime does have its flaws. The pacing can be uneven sometimes, with specific episodes feeling rushed or lacking substance. Other than that, some viewers might find the protagonist&rsquo;s initial attitude and behaviour off-putting. The overall theme is quite typical, and most audiences don&rsquo;t find it interesting.</p>
			<p>In conclusion, I recommend this anime if you want an ordinary fantasy anime or something to kill time. Keep your expectations low and just enjoy it momentarily. </p>
