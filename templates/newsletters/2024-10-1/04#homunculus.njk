			<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p>What is horror? It is the feeling of great shock or fear, but what causes the fear? Our minds. The sense of horror is a survival adaptation that our brains developed, something to get us away from precarious situations. But can it help to get away from somewhere we can’t escape from? Our very minds.</p>

			<p>In this article, we will observe how our minds entrap us. We will discuss the story from the manga Homunculus to analyse the tricks our consciousness plays with us. And, of course, spoilers ahead.</p>

			<h2>Different Face, Same Person.</h2>

			<p>The manga follows the journey of a middle-aged man Susumu Nakoshi who spends his days living in a car between a first-class hotel and a homeless park. Nakoshi used to work for a major foreign financial company, but he is homeless now and that’s by choice. Nakoshi had undergone a facial reconstruction surgery which changed his facial appearance to unrecognisable from his earlier face. Nakoshi detested the way he looked, and that is why he burned down all the objects that possessed his resemblance. This act of self-erasure caused more harm to him than good. He started to forget himself.</p>
			
			<p>After the surgery, Nakoshi prospered in his job and landed a good position. He was also successful in going out with women but there was something that was eating him from inside. He knew that he could never have gotten things with his old look. His real self was determined by the way he used to look. What is a real self? Does it remain constant or change with time? These questions haunted him. Nakoshi took a break from his job and started living in a car near the hotel he used to go to. Nakoshi found a connection between himself and the homeless people who put up tents in the park. He thought that if he could understand them, he could understand himself. Since they are the ones who have been through a lot and have also had past lives they have forgotten. Nakoshi had abandoned his love of life before getting the surgery, and he had a tough time remembering her too. He had placed barriers in his mind which stopped him from thinking about his past self. He wanted to break the barriers he had created. For which he took some of the most drastic takes possible.</p>

			<h2>Trepanation</h2>

			<p>After being lured by Manabu Ito, a 22-year-old medical student, Nakoshi agrees to let him drill a hole in his skull in exchange for 700,000 yen. Ito presents Nakoshi with the argument that while growing up, our skull fuses and creates pressure inside, which inhibits childlike thinking and curiosity. When it is drilled, the brain is de-pressurised and may function in miraculous ways. Nakoshi is drawn towards this approach and thinks it will solve his problems. He undergoes the process but does not seem to have any changes in his perceptions, but then something happens. Nakoshi when he looks at anyone with his right eye closed sees them as a distorted collection of matter. He terms them as ‘Homunculus’. </p>

			<p>Initially, he thinks of these absurdities as hallucinations but later when he talks with one he realises the homunculus he sees is the visual representation of their innermost despair. When Nakoshi talks to a homunculus about their greatest despair, the source of their pain, the homunculus seems to fade away while leaving part of Nakoshi distorted the same way as the homunculus.</p>

			<h2>Delusions or Reality?</h2>

			<p>The homunculus that Nakoshi sees raises questions about his state of mind. Is he alright in the head? He first dismisses these visuals as hallucinations. And he is not wrong either; They qualify all the checks for being hallucinations. But when he starts to interact deeply with them, he understands that that's not the case. But how reliable is this? Is his brain playing tricks on him again?</p>

			<p>This aspect of the story is what is the most fearful. How real are the things he is seeing? Are the normal-appearing people homunculus, too? How strange it might feel to see this world through your eyes. To accept this reality of morphed people is something only an insane person can endure. And Nakoshi by all means is not sane. When Nakoshi talks to a homunculus, it requires a great deal of knowing that person to see them as humans. And they leave a part of themselves in Nakoshi. How many people can one Nakoshi cure? Won’t he lose the shape of himself if he does this too many times? Not that Nakoshi hasn’t lost himself in the past either. Nakoshi tries to get rid of these by trying to close the hole in his skull but it is to no avail. He keeps seeing them.</p>

			<h2>Losing Oneself</h2>

			<p>While trying to find his old self, Nakoshi loses himself. And with his new ‘powers’, he goes too far off the edge. He gets obsessed with these Homunculus. He starts to care more about the inner despairs of others than himself. Nakoshi meets a woman and gets obsessed with her. Since her Homunculus appears to have no face. The woman is an escort, and not knowing her fully, pains Nakoshi far more than expected. His obsession with seeing the homunculus makes him perform another trepanation on himself.</p>

			<p>After this, when he meets the woman again, he concludes that she is the woman he used to love once, Nanako. She used to have an ‘unattractive’ face and underwent cosmetic surgery to change her appearance, and turns out she also lost a part of herself after it. She reminds Nakoshi of himself before the trepanation. </p>

			<h2>Seeing Others</h2>

			<p>Nakoshi manages to convince her of trepanation and drills a hole into her head. This does not result in the same thing it did for him, instead he sees himself in Nakoshi. He is either enlightened or has gone completely insane. He takes pleasure in the fact that Nanako looks like him now. Nanako passes away after some time. But Nakoshi is unaware of it. He goes outside and he sees himself, his face in everyone, All have become him. He is in everyone. He sees others as he sees himself. Broken. Nakoshi. Maybe this homunculus thing was a big facade put by his mind to make him realise this. He is everyone. With the pleasure of seeing himself in everyone. Nakoshi goes on the loose. He drills more holes in himself and others. And eventually gets arrested.</p>

			<p>The journey of Nakoshi forces us to think about whether all the things that transpired were a result of trepanation or just a trigger. We can’t escape from our minds. We can set barriers but barriers are eventually broken and when it does all hell breaks loose. This aspect of psychological horror is far more disturbing than actual horror. We can’t break free from the way we view this world.</p>
