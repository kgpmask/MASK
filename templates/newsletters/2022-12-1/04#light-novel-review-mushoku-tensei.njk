			<p>Mushoku Tensei follows a 34-year old recluse, who gets reborn as Rudeus in a world filled with magic, after dying while trying to save some students. Sounds like every other generic isekai story? It's far from it. It has a Manga adaptation with 15 volumes and 2 seasons of anime adaptation so far (23 Ep +  1 OVA), and a good reason to believe that a 3rd Season is already under production.</p>

			{# <p>A few charm points of Mushoku Tensei are:</p> #}
			<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
				<li><b>Extensive World Building:</b><br/> The world map is very well defined right from the first book. The main character, Rudeus, explores every part of it at some point in the story. Every city of the map has well defined descriptions and is expressed with extreme detail. Every place feels very much alive and the reader finds themselves immersed into the world. Culture, religion, technology, economy, and politics are all linked to the world and have their own history and origins. There is no narrator explaining how everything works nor convenient descriptions purely for teaching; it's just the readers getting the same intellectual experience as the protagonist who learns more about the world, the history, the languages, and social norms, over time. The first-person perspectives allow the readers to feel more connected with the narrative and learn at the same pace as the character.<br/><center><img src="/assets/releases/2022-12-1/4.webp" style="max-width: 90%; display: block;"></center></li><br/>

				<li><b>A well defined Power System: </b><br/> This example is for Magic, same ranks apply for Swordsmanship as well.

				</table></center></li><br/>
				<li><b>Intense fights:</b><br/> Despite having very talented magic and sword users, there are only a small number of fights and battles, with each one having meaning in furthering someone's motives or growth. Rudeus, the main character, tries to stay away from getting into fights as much as possible, but when they do take place, they are intense and spectacular. There are not too many fights but the big ones are masterpieces. Rudeus is a tactical genius and the main enemies are OP. The contrast of power and the strategies involved leaves a deep impression on the minds of the readers.</li><br/>

				<li><b>Overarching Plots:</b><br/> The run of 26 books is just a prelude to the main story featuring the Reincarnation of the Demon ‘Laplace’. Laplace is said to reincarnate every 500 years after his death. The story starts 407 years after the death of Laplace. The last book ends in the year 481. Yes, the main antagonist, Laplace, hasn't been born yet. Mushoku Tensei is just a prologue to the main plot which is yet to start. The incident that brings our main character Rudeus into the world is also part of the larger story that has been explained only briefly. The entire world and many powerful characters that live for hundreds of years are preparing for the birth of Laplace, which doesn't even happen at the end of Mushoku Tensei. The anticipation of the prophecy that is yet to take place gives the readers the same feeling as the characters in the story. Despite being only a prelude to a much bigger story that is yet to take place, Mushoku Tensei is an incredible masterpiece in and of itself. The readers are left satisfied after every book and the grandiose plot makes so much sense as it's presented through one character's viewpoint. Yes, there are a lot of moving points and separate storylines, but the readers are unaware of the complete picture and are only presented as passing stories that Rudeus hears in his journey.</li><br/>

				<li><b>Detailed Character Development:</b><br/> As the story progresses, each character grows and learns from their surroundings. There is always a change in attitude and drive of every character as the story progresses. Mushoku Tensei follows the entire lifespan of Rudeus. His experiences from all the events shape how he acts and changes how he thinks. Being a story that spans years the readers can see a contrast in each character's motivations and goals from when they were first introduced and when they return later.<br/><br/>
				<p>Lets meet a few Mushoku Tensei characters:</p><br/>
				<img src="/assets/releases/2022-12-1/5.webp" style="height: 96px; float: left; display: block; padding: 0px 5px; margin: 0px;"><p><b>Rudeus Greyrat:</b> The Isekai’d Hero<br/>The main character, who has potential to be OP but never does throughout the run of the story. A lecherous 34 year old who decided to do better in his new life as Rudeus. He uses his knowledge to overcome the shortcomings of his previous life, and is careful not to get carried away. Rudeus tries his best to live this new life with no regrets to leave behind. <br/>The Light Novel is written from Rudeus’ first person perspective. The readers learn about the world along with Rudeus’ through his narration.</p><br/>
				<img src="/assets/releases/2022-12-1/6.webp" style="height: 96px; float: left; display: block; padding: 0px 5px; margin: 0px;"><p><b>Zenith Greyrat:</b> The Doting Mother<br/>Rudeus’ mom, a cheerful healer who loves Rudeus a lot. She ran away from her home and joined Paul’s adventuring party. She has a warm, loving and gentle personality but can also be strict when needed. After seeing Rudeus’ potential for magic, she wants Rudeus to be a magician like her.</p><br/><br/><br/>
				<img src="/assets/releases/2022-12-1/7.webp" style="height: 96px; float: left; display: block; padding: 0px 5px; margin: 0px;"><p><b>Paulo Greyrat:</b> The Useless Dad<br/>Rudeus’ dad, a skilled swordsman who became skilled in swordsmanship at a very young age. He has a bold and confident personality and is a known womaniser. After meeting Zenith, she made him swear to be faithful to her only. Paul has the tendency to jump to conclusions and act without thinking. He was always learning from Rudeus’ calm demeanour. Paul wants Rudeus to be a swordsman and trains Rudeus himself.</p><br/><br/>
				<img src="/assets/releases/2022-12-1/8.webp" style="height: 96px; float: left; display: block; padding: 0px 5px; margin: 0px;"><p><b>Roxy Migurdia:</b> The Loli Sensei<br/>The first heroine we encounter. Roxy is hired as Rudeus’ magic instructor by his mother Zenith. She might look like a little girl, but she is 44 years old when she meets Rudeus for the first time. Her heritage is that of the Migurdia clan, a demon race, who look like teenagers throughout their lifespan of around 200 years. She is a skilled magician and had been travelling the continent as an adventurer, before accepting the job as Rudeus’ tutor. Rudeus graduates from her tutoring after he learns everything she had to teach. Long after that Rudeus worships and prays on a particular piece of clothing (*coughs*) that was <i><del>stolen</i></del> left behind, and starts a secret religion in her name which has only one devout follower, Rudeus himself.</p><br/>
				<img src="/assets/releases/2022-12-1/9.webp" style="height: 96px; float: left; display: block; padding: 0px 5px; margin: 0px;"><p><b>Sylphiette:</b> The Shy Childhood Friend<br/>Rudeus meets Sylpiette after graduating from Roxy Sensei's tutoring, while she was being bullied by the neighbouring kids. He saves her and she takes a liking to him. Unfortunately, Rudeus mistakes her to be a boy which leads to a certain…Err… <i>situation</i> (*coughs*). <br/>Sylpie is a shy and introverted half elf. She displays talent for magic thus Rudeus takes on himself the role of her teacher. They spend a lot of time together which causes her to depend on Rudeus a lot. She would break down crying when Rudeus would leave her. They were forcefully separated from each other when Paul decided to send Rudeus far away for a job.</p><br/>
				<img src="/assets/releases/2022-12-1/10.webp" style="height: 96px; float: left; display: block; padding: 0px 5px; margin: 0px;"><p><b>Eris Boreas Greyrat:</b> The Hothead Tsundere<br/>Rudeus wants to earn money to attend the Ranoa Magic Academy (Roxy’s Alma mater). For this he has to tutor Eris, a problem child of noble origin. Eris is known to be very difficult to handle and many tutors before her were unable to withstand a single session with her. When first meeting Rudeus, she is defiant, pompous, condescending and impulsive.<br/>Over time she learns to be better and Rudeus is able to find a way to teach her. She remains the same hothead but learns to control it when it comes to Rudeus. She lacks aptitude for magic but is able to outperform Rudeus in swordsmanship.</p><br/>

			<h3>Afterword:</h3>
			<p>Mushoku Tensei may have its morally questionable actions and views, a troubled protagonist and many personal problems that were present before his death and reincarnation, despite which the story has established itself as so much more than persistent action and generic isekai like its counterparts, with a stellar
			collection of characters and a deep and intriguing story.</p><p>
			Mushoku Tensei is first, and foremost, a redemption story, with a touch of humour and over the top fights against terrible odds, along with a romance fantasy narrative and offers something different with each volume and excels for the most part in whatever it takes to accomplish narratively and emotionally.</p><p> Rifujin na Magonote, the story's author, used a generic theme to create characters and a world, but unlike generic fantasy light novels, he puts effort into creating depth for the characters and its world. Mushoku Tensei is arguably the best Isekai story I have ever read. There are just too many elements to this story besides Rudeus’ development that leaves an impression. I can only praise how amazing the writing and storytelling is from start to finish. Every story element feels so well thought out that it feels like the author crafted the world and many plot points before he even began writing about the main character.</p><p> I'm really grateful that I got to read this series and am glad to have experienced the complex and bizarre yet touching and empowering, and genuinely a life-changing journey that is Mushoku Tensei. A must read for all Isekai Fans.</p>
