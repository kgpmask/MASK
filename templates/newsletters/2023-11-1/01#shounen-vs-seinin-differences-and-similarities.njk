			<center><h2>What is Shounen</h2></center></br>
			<p>Shounen (or shonen) is a Japanese term that literally means “boy”. As such, shounen anime and manga are primarily aimed at young male audiences, typically ranging from 12 to 18 years old. However, this does not mean that shounen anime is only for boys, as many girls and adults also enjoy this category.</p>

			<p>Shounen anime is usually characterized by action-packed storylines, with themes of friendship, courage, justice, adventure, and humor.</p>

            <p>Shounen protagonists are often young male heroes who have a goal or a dream to achieve, and who face various challenges and enemies along the way. They also tend to have special abilities or powers, such as magic, martial arts, or superpowers.</p>
			
			<p>Some of the most popular and influential shounen anime and manga include Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball, Bleach, Hunter x Hunter, My Hero Academia, Demon Slayer, Fullmetal Alchemist and many more.</p>

			<center><h2>What is Seinen</h2></center></br>
			<p>Seinen (or seinen) is another Japanese term that means “young man”. Seinen anime and manga are mainly targeted at adult male audiences, usually ranging from 20+ years old. However, like shounen, seinen anime can also appeal to other demographics, especially those who prefer more mature and complex themes.</p>

			<p>Seinen anime is often characterized by relatively darker, grittier, and more realistic storylines, with themes of violence, sexuality, politics, psychology, philosophy, and social issues.</p>

            <p>Seinen protagonists are usually older or more mature than shounen heroes, and they face more serious and realistic problems and dilemmas. They also tend to have more human flaws and weaknesses than shounen heroes.</p>
			
			<p>Some of the most popular and acclaimed seinen anime and manga include Berserk, Monster, Psycho-Pass, Ghost in the Shell, Parasyte, Vinland Saga, Steins; Gate.</p>
