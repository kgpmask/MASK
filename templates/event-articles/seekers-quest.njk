			Hey, MASK. I know you've been conducting some quizzes for a while now. It's all good, but I feel like something has changed.<br>
			I mean, it's kinda boring how we just sit in Vikramshila with our computers, attempting a quiz in a room full of people, without really discussing with our friends.<br>
			Wouldn't it be better if you did something, I don't know, which I can enjoy with my friends or something?

		&emsp;- Nobody. This narration is fictional. The next part, not so much.

	With this line of thought, we decided that it was time we let go of our online link and proceed with a completely offline event for teams. The <b>Anime Seekers' Quest</b> was a treasure hunt planned shortly after the <a href="/events/qatq" title="Quad Anime Trivia Quiz">Quad Anime Trivia Quiz</a>. Teams of up to 3 people spent 2 hours, using the clues provided and their anime knowledge (and Google... yes, we allowed it.) around 2.2 covering various locations in a quest to claim their prizes from a treasure curated just for the anime fans.
