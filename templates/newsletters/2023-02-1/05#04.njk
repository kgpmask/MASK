			<p>Easily misunderstood, unable to strike up a conversation with girls, and a social pariah both by circumstance and choice. It is Hachiman Hikigaya, the protagonist of Oregairu; I am not making fun of you people. Sounds familiar, doesn't it—a guy who gave up on his social life and, as a result, on romance—a guy who gave up on expecting anything. Well, not completely, but in part. Oregairu is a rom-com drama that will leave you thinking deeply by the end of the episode. It is the story of a love triangle with a pessimistic protagonist, a separated perfectionist girl suffering from her complex, and a kind, optimistic and joyful, albeit slightly dumb girl. When watching this series, certain things could seem unnecessary or even pointless, and you might wonder why a character did what they did. However, because each character is well-developed, you will eventually come to understand, relate to, and sympathise with them.</p>
			<p>This show depicts the complicated and awkward friendship of three teenagers who are all dealing with social discomfort. Oregairu is a powerful show that will repay you for the time you put into watching all three seasons. It will teach you the essentials and value of human interactions.</p>
