      <p><b>NPC-1: </b>Hey, have you seen Naruto?</p>

      <p><b>NPC-2: </b>Yeah, it was one of the best shonen I have ever seen.</p>

      <p><b>NPC-1: </b>What aspect did you find most intriguing or thought-provoking, and why?</p>

      <p><b>NPC-2: </b>The most thought-provoking realisation for me was about the villains of Naruto—it made me question and reconsider my entire perspective on the nature of antagonist society.</p>

      <center><b>Let's see how they can affect yours.</b></center>

      <h3>Why the Villains of Naruto Are Built Different</h3>

      <p>Let’s admit it—Naruto’s world has some of the most unforgettable villains in anime history. Unlike your typical "I want treasure, power, and world domination" bad guys, Naruto’s antagonists have something deeper going on, something everyone can't understand. These aren’t just evil-for-the-sake-of-it villains; they’re people with tragic pasts, ideals, and philosophies that’ll make you sit back and question everything you thought was right. And no, we’re not exaggerating. The villains here aren’t just chasing destruction like others—they’re chasing peace. Yes, peace—through wildly extreme, questionable methods, but hey, some points for effort, right?</p>

      <p>Let’s break down why Naruto’s villains stand out and how they outshine the bad guys from other series.</p>

      <h3>Complex and Tragic Backstories</h3>

      <p>In <i>Naruto</i>, villains aren’t born evil. They’re victims of their circumstances, and honestly, it makes them agonisingly relatable. Their actions usually emanate from heartbreaking events, betrayal, or loss that hit way too close to home.</p>

      <p><img src="/assets/releases/2024-11-1/2-4.webp" alt="." style="height: calc(min(100px, 5vw));float: left; margin-right: 15px;">Take Nagato, aka Pain, for example. This guy saw his parents and best friend get killed during the war, and what did he do? He turned his pain (pun intended) into a twisted philosophy: peace through fear. He even built his wicked psychologies that could support his beliefs.
      </p>

      <center>"We are but men, drawn to act in the name of revenge we deem to be 'justice'." <br/>
      “Those who do not understand true pain can never understand true peace.” </center>

      <p style="margin-left: 70%;"> - Pain</p> 

      <p>Then there’s Obito Uchiha, a sweet kid dreaming of becoming Hokage. Fast-forward to him watching the love of his life die, and boom, next thing you know, he’s being manipulated and converted into a nihilist by Lord Madara. </p>

      <center>"Talking about peace whilst spilling blood, it's something that only humans can do."<br/>        "The only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain, suffering and futility." </center>

      <p style="margin-left: 70%;"> - Madara Uchiha</p>

      <p>Sure, other anime villains like Zeke Yeager (<i>Attack on Titan</i>) and Doflamingo (<i>One Piece</i>) also have tragic pasts. Still, <i>Naruto</i> villains tie their pain to a more significant cause: achieving peace. That extra layer of idealism makes them stand out among anything we've seen.</p>

      <h3>The “Good vs. Evil” Blur</h3>

      <p>If you’re expecting clear-cut heroes and villains in Naruto, you might wanna reconsider it. The series prospers in the thin line between good and evil, serving as the perfect backdrop for these villains to stand out.</p>

      <p>Pain, for example, believed that mutual suffering was the only way to achieve peace. I guess he even lived by the quote, “An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth”. Sounds harsh?, but when you hear his reasoning, it’s hard not to see his point. Nagato’s perspective was rooted in the belief that <b>enduring suffering and making significant sacrifices are essential steps toward achieving lasting peace.</b> This viewpoint was influenced by his challenging childhood and his aspiration to resolve the ongoing conflicts that have affected his world. Then there’s Madara, who thought trapping everyone in a fake utopia was better than the endless cycle of war. Sounds poetic, doesn't it? Believe me when I say he got this wisdom from countless miseries and accidents.</p>

      <p>Even Zabuza—remember him from the early episodes? The first villain-like being of this masterpiece. He was a ruthless assassin, sure, but his bond with Haku gave us a glimpse of his humanity. This just confirmed for me that this anime isn't going to be like other shonen.</p>

      <p>Now, compare this to villains in <i>Dragon Ball</i> (like Frieza) or <i>Bleach</i> (like Aizen). Don’t get me wrong—they’re iconic, but their motivations are usually about power or domination. <i>Naruto</i> villains, on the other hand, hit you with existential questions about morality and leave you sitting there like, “Wait… actually, they do have a point?”</p>

      <h3>Villains Who Could’ve Been Naruto</h3>

      <p>Here’s what makes Naruto villains hit even harder: they’re mirrors of the protagonist. I mean, actually, what is going on? How can some seem-to-be villains have similarities with the main protagonist? This was my viewpoint, but many of them show us what Naruto himself could have become under different circumstances.</p>

      <p>Remember Gaara? He started as a psychotic loner fueled by hatred, but his story was eerily similar to Naruto’s. The difference? Naruto found friends, while Gaara found… chaos. Yeah, it might sound exaggerated, but undeniably, he had nothing but chaos in his early life. </p>

      <p>Then we have Obito, who’s literally “Naruto gone wrong.” He gave up on his ideals after life kicked him down one too many times. And let’s not forget Sasuke, who danced on the line between villain and anti-hero, showing us the cost of revenge versus reconciliation.
      </p>

      <p>Other anime villains, like Shigaraki (<i>My Hero Academia</i>) or Meruem (<i>Hunter x Hunter</i>), also parallel their protagonists, but in Naruto, these parallels drive the entire story forward, making every fight feel personal and meaningful.</p>

      <h3>Redemption Arcs that Hit Hard</h3>

      <p>One thing <i>Naruto</i> does better than most of the so-called shonen, is giving its villains a chance to redeem themselves. They’re not just evil for the sake of it (I mean, who is born evil and wants just to destroy everything) —they’re flawed people trying (and often failing) to do what they think is right.</p>

      <p>Itachi Uchiha? First, he’s framed as the coldest killer ever. Then, plot twist: he’s actually a tragic hero who sacrificed everything for his little brother. Nagato? He literally brings people back to life after Naruto convinces him his philosophy was flawed. And let’s not forget Zabuza, who, in his last moments, mourns the loss of Haku and reminds us that even the darkest hearts can feel love.</p>

      <p>While redemption arcs exist in other anime (looking at “Zuko, Vegeta”), they often focus on each of their personal growth. In <i>Naruto</i>, redemption ties directly to the villains’ big-picture goals—peace, forgiveness, and understanding.</p>

      <h3>Philosophical Punches</h3>

      <p>If <i>Naruto</i> villains were just tragic and redeemable, that’d be impressive enough. But nope—these characters also present a philosophy so thought-provoking that it compels you to contemplate the validity of their perspective.</p>

      <p>Pain’s idea of the “cycle of hatred” is a heavy reminder of real-world struggles to end violence. Madara’s belief that humanity can’t achieve true peace without control is terrifyingly thought-provoking. And Obito? His downfall proves that one tragedy can completely derail even the most optimistic person.</p>

      <p>Other anime touches on profound themes—like Meruem in <i>Hunter x Hunter</i> exploring morality or Griffith in <i>Berserk</i> embodying ambition—but <i>Naruto</i> villains always circle back to one question: can peace exist without sacrifice? That recurring theme ties them together in a way that’s rare to see.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion: Villains Who Stick with You</h3>

      <p>The villains in <i>Naruto</i> aren’t just bad guys—they’re fully fleshed-out characters with dreams, flaws, and enough emotional depth to leave a mark. The series turns battles into meaningful clashes of philosophy and emotion by focusing on their idealistic (but flawed) pursuit of peace.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, these villains remind us that even the darkest hearts can seek redemption and that every conflict has two sides. Whether they’re breaking your heart or challenging your morals, the villains of <i>Naruto</i> make one thing clear: they’re in a league of their own.</p>
