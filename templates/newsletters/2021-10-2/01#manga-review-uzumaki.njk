			<p>Uzumaki is a Japanese horror manga series written and illustrated by Junji Ito. It was published in Big Comic Spirits from 1998 to 1999. It was officially translated into English by Viz Media, and it is available on their website to read. The author is known for writing horror mangas and some of his notable works are Tomie and Gyo. The manga depicts bodily horror, which includes grotesque deformation of people into spirals, humans changing into animals, and destruction of the human body. It also portrays vampirism and cannibalism, although not in the traditional sense. The manga has been adapted into a live-action film and an anime is in the works and is slated to release in October 2022.</p>
			<p>Uzumaki is set in a fictional city of Kurouzu-cho, a normal city at first glance which is slowly consumed by seemingly disconnected horrible events, except they all involve spirals, hence the name of the manga. The city is bordered by sea and mountains on two sides.</p>
			<p>The story is told from the point of view of high-school teenager Kirie Goshima who finds herself constantly tangled in different horrors involving people in her surroundings, with one thing in common: they all involve spirals. This starts with the obsession of her boyfriend’s father with spirals. There are only 19 chapters in the manga, but each chapter is densely packed with story. Different aspects of the spiral curse are explored in each chapter and its effects become progressively worse with chapters. The reasons for these supernatural events are beyond the comprehension of humans in the manga and hence that of the reader. This gives the author leeway to explain the disconnected events just as the effects of curse, but still there are some occurrences which don’t make sense even with this assumption. This might leave a bad taste in your mouth if you are the kind of person who doesn’t like loose plot threads, but with that mystery, it also leaves you with a sense of curiosity to wonder about it. For me it invoked mixed feelings, first feeling let down and later, an acceptance that humans weren’t simply far enough to comprehend it, and other endings might have been a bit out of place.</p>
			<p>The characters are nothing out of ordinary. They are people as you would expect from real life; not even the POV character has any special abilities. Only one of the characters is able to sense danger and has ominous feelings about the city — Kirie’s boyfriend —  but it is strictly limited to bad vibes. In this story, none of the characters are consequential, they are just vessels to explore the different effects of the curse. This shows in the plot clearly as no other aspects of characters are explored apart from their involvement in the incident of spiral curse. As such, there is negligible connection with the characters. The bad side of this is it makes the events less impactful as you aren’t able to sympathise with the characters, but at the same time it spares you from being sad while you are horrified.</p>
			<p>The art is detailed and the panelling is superb. You can breeze through the manga without any hiccups. One could say that the author has a knack for drawing horror. The art is enough to send a chill down your spine and it boosts the impact of unfolding events even further. You should know by the genre of the manga itself, but if you are repulsed by grotesque art, you might want to stay away from this manga as it leverages that to its full extent. Do note, however, that doing this will deprive you the experience of admittedly one of the best manga in this genre.</p>
			<p>There is no other way to put it - if you are not averse to the horror genre and haven’t read Uzumaki till now, dive in. It can be read completely in one sitting, and you will have a great time.</p>
