		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			Being among the newer societies of IIT Kharagpur, MASK was established in 2020 when anime was gaining popularity at an incredible rate due to the lockdown. 
			Our founding members wanted to create a place to spread anime culture at IIT Kharagpur and make a place for anime fans to come together and share their enthusiasm.<br/>
