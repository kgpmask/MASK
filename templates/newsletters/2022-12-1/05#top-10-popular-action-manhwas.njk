			<h3 style="text-align:center">10. Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</h3>
			<p>"I am Dokja. A reader." As Kim Dokja finishes reading his favourite web novel "Three Ways to Survive an Apocalypse (TWSA)", he finds an author note, which allows him to download the whole novel before it becomes paid content. Once it is downloaded, the lights in the train he was travelling start to flicker, and scenes which he was all too familiar with were happening. The novel, TWAS, was becoming a reality, and Kim Dokja is the only one who has read it to the end. Will Kim Dokja be able to survive the apocalypse? Or will he conquer the stage while surpassing even the protagonist of the novel, a regressor with years of experience? Read this absolute hit to find out.</p>
			<p>This adaptation of the popular web novel of the same name has all three things which make something worth reading: an awesome plot, stunning visuals and some awesome characters. If you pick this up and are awestruck by the story already, you will be dumbfounded to find out what's in store.</p>

			<h3 style="text-align:center">9. Overgeared</h3>
			<p>Shin Youngwoo is an unlucky loser in both real life and the most popular virtual reality game 'Satisfy' in which he plays Grid. When Grid finds the legendary class change item 'Pagma's Rare Book' in an S-class quest, he unfortunately dies, making him a level -1 player as a consequence of changing classes and dying in the middle of an S-Class quest. This manhwa focuses on Grid, as he makes his way from being the first negative-levelled player to the most powerful, or rather, 'Overgeared' character in the world of Satisfy.</p>
			<p>The consistent pacing and development of the story over various arcs is what has held the Manhwa's popularity and allowed its creator to publish a 1750+ chapter web novel.</p>

			<h3 style="text-align:center">8. The God of High School</h3>
			<p>"The best fighter, I'm the best fighter." 17-year-old Mori Jin, a prodigy who learned Taekwondo from his grandfather, had no losses in any fights he participated in, that is until he was invited to the 'God of High School' competition. His first loss is when he fights the commissioner who invites him to the competition. After experiencing his first defeat, Mori Jin chooses to participate in the competition to fight strong people from all over the world. This absolute mixture of action, comedy and folklore has finally ended, making this probably the perfect time to pick it up (or pick it back up in case you left it during one of its many breaks)</p>
			<p>While this series started as a way of merging different lores and myths through a fight show, the story has evolved into something far greater than what it is, leading to a grand universe of action which you just can't get tired of.</p>

			<h3 style="text-align:center">7. Return of the Blossoming Blade (alt: Return of the Mount Hua Sect)</h3>
			<p>Chung Myung, the Plum Blossom Sword Saint, finds himself dying on the battlefield after killing the demon Chun Ma. However, he is reincarnated in a beggar child's body 100 years after he died against Chun Ma. What surprises the master of the blade is that the Mount Hua Sect, whose swordsmanship was recognized by Chun Ma as the strongest, is not even one of the top Twelve Sects. This story revolves around the reincarnated Chung Myung's efforts in restoring the Mount Hua Sect to its former glory.</p>
			<p>This manhwa is known for the protagonist's seemingly two-faced behaviour and comedic expressions throughout the story, be it 'charming' his brothers into becoming stronger, or ripping off a merchant using his skills (mild spoilers; harmless without context)</p>

			<h3 style="text-align:center">6. Mercenary Enrollment (alt: Teenage Mercenary)</h3>
			<p>After being separated from his family 10 years ago in a plane crash, Yu Ijin is finally reunited with his family in Korea. When he is enrolled in high school, he experiences a lot of new things, like friendships, PC cafes, gaming and even bullying. What most people don't know is that Ijin was one of the world's deadliest mercenaries. This Manhwa revolves around Ijin as he adjusts to his new life while encountering various friends and foes, new and old alike.</p>
			<p>This manhwa is an absolute favourite among many for its action sequences and how it turns simple day-to-day events into comedic events without changing the pacing of the story as a whole.</p>

			<h3 style="text-align:center">4. Noblesse</h3>
			<p>This manhwa is about Cadis Etrama di Raizel, or as everyone calls him, Rai. Waking up after 820 long years, Rai finds himself in the modern world. As he blends in using the most common type of clothing - a school uniform, he finds an old friend as the school's headmaster. Read this story about a 'noble', a being with supernatural abilities, as he learns more about life in the human world while also taking on the evils of the world.</p>
			<p>This Manhwa gained popularity with its character designs and developments, while also including comedy in the most simple and seemingly obvious things.</p>

			<h3 style="text-align:center">3. Eleceed</h3>
			<p>From the author of Noblesse, this manhwa focuses on the adventures of a cat-loving boy, Seo Jisoo who is fast (and I mean really fast) and, you guessed it (no you didn’t), a talking cat. Kayden, a man with the ability to transform and use electricity, turns into a stray cat when he is injured. As fate would have it, Kayden’s the talking cat. Read this story to find out why Kayden was injured, how Jisoo adjusts to his powers and what the biggest mess this dynamic duo can get themselves into.</p>
			<p>Why is it popular? It’s pretty simple. It has a new story concept, some top-tier comedy and most importantly, cats!!!</p>

			<h3 style="text-align:center">2. Tower Of God</h3>
			<p>25th Bam finds Rachel, the only person he has known his whole life, leaving him to climb the Tower.

Watch Bam climb the tower in his quest to find Rachel, while making a lot of allies, going through tough ordeals, and large forces which act behind the scenes.</p>
			<p>The fascinating thing about this Manhwa is how any reader will find something new every time they re-read the series. The author SIU has done a marvellous job with the plot and the characters.</p>

			<h3 style="text-align:center">1. Solo Leveling</h3>
			<p>Sung Jin-Woo, an F-class hunter with nothing specifically remarkable about his abilities, finds himself trapped in a double dungeon. Moments before his death, he gets a notification. "You have obtained the right to become a player. Do you accept it?" Once he accepts it, he finds himself in the hospital after being unconscious for three days. With all his injuries healed, and a status window with quests, penalties and much more, Jin-Woo starts pushing himself to become the best hunter of all time.</p>
			<p>This is definitely the most popular Manhwa. While this Manhwa gained fame because of its art and story, it also became a trendsetter in many ways, the most common one being how most new Manhwas have a 'player system' for the protagonist. While this theme has been prevalent for a while, its use has increased by a drastic margin after Solo Leveling.</p>
