						<p>Do you dream of your crush wearing a cute cosplay outfit, like a bunny girl or a maid? Get help, no, seriously. Coming back to the show, it is not the sweetest romance, not the most lighthearted. In fact, it is far from either. This is the anime that plunged us to tears, more than once. This anime is an ultimate masterpiece of romance, humour, drama, excitement, philosophy, and psychology because it portrays love, care, helplessness, weakness, anxiety, agony, desire, and loneliness in their most raw forms. Although Sakuta, the protagonist, is one of the anime world's most laid-back characters, his passive effort for the benefit of the people he loves about moved us more than most anime protagonists. On the other hand, Mai attempts to taunt Sakuta while acting all grown up and gets consistently UNO REVERSED by Sakuta. The portrayal of the other supporting characters is equally remarkable, with no lack of growth. You'll laugh at the characters' antics, cry at their situation, and feel passionately moved by how fervently and desperately they try to fix the issues in this anime.</p>
						<p>To top it all off, the movie had more romance than the anime's first arc and more emotion and sadness than its last arc. The film truly moved our hearts more than any anime film we have ever seen, with the exception of one. Continue reading to learn more about that movie.</p>
