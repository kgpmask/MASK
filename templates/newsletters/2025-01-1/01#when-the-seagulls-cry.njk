			<p>I cannot properly start this article without mentioning the fabulous soundtrack for the game. Words cannot begin to define my love for the OST, so instead, I have linked a few songs below, which I highly recommend you give a listen (maybe while reading this article).<br>

			<p><i>Without love, it cannot be seen</i></p>

			<p><a href="https://vndb.org/v24">Umineko no Naku Koro Ni</a> is the second visual novel in the “When They Cry” series, preceded by <a href="https://vndb.org/v67">Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni</a>. It is divided into two parts: the Question Arcs (Episodes 1 to 4) and the Answer Arcs (Episodes 5 to 8). I had started reading this behemoth of a story back in September 2024, and after 150+ hours of reading, I finally finished it in early January 2025. The reading time may be extremely long, but the game has over 1.1 million words so I feel it is justified. For comparison, all seven Harry Potter books combined have a word count of just over a million words.</p>

			<p>After reading something for such an extended period, a person really can’t hate the series. The reason for that may or may not be Stockholm Syndrome, only Beatrice knows. Regardless to say, this series has left a lasting impression on me, and I will be using this article as an outlet for my thoughts and emotions about this game. And if this article gets you interested in reading the series, nothing would make me happier.</p>

			<p>Umineko is a Murder Mystery story, and many people might not be pleased with the idea of reading an article containing spoilers. So, if you are someone who enjoys going into stories completely blind, then put this article on hold and go read Umineko. Who knows, it may become a life-changing experience for you as well.</p>

			<p>For the rest of the readers, let me assure you that the topics I will be discussing won’t hamper your enjoyment in the slightest, even if you plan to read Umineko after my article. It might even give you a strong base to notice the small details early on in the story and appreciate the finer details even more.</p>

			<center><h3>Legend of the Golden Witch</h3></center>

			<h4><a href="https://imgur.com/tLkRNxb">Episode 1 Character List</a></h4>

			<p>The story of Umineko is set in 1986 on the fictional island of Rokkenjima, located in the coastal islands near Japan. Rokkenjima is owned by Ushiromiya Kinzo, an extremely wealthy man who made his money in post-World War 2 Japan. Now, he is an extremely old man in his seventies and has grown quite senile. You can hear loud cries of longing coming from his room for a woman named Beatrice, who the residents of Rokkenjima believe to be an old confidant/lover of Kinzo’s.</p>

			<p>However, a more mystical take on the story is that Beatrice is a witch who gave Kinzo ten tons of gold, which he used to build his fortune. Kinzo himself validated this idea by being a crazed practitioner of black magic in an attempt to revive his beloved Beatrice. He even hung a massive portrait of Beatrice in the main hall of his mansion, with a golden epitaph under it. <a href="https://imgur.com/6sB9afk">Epitaph</a><br>Taken at face value, it reads like a ritual to revive the dead, very in theme with something Kinzo would do, but most considered the epitaph to be a riddle whose solution would lead to the mountain of gold Kinzo owned. The members of the Ushiromiya family and servants had all tried to solve the epitaph, but all had failed, so they had mostly given up on it.</p>

			<p>The only residents of the island are Kinzo, his servants, and the family of his first-born son Krauss, who will succeed him to become the head of the Ushiromiya household. But, every year, an annual conference is held where all of Kinzo’s children and his family come together to have a conference with their father to discuss the conditions of their companies and other such matters. To the children, though, these matters seem superfluous in nature and show a crueler side to their parents, blinded by greed and fortune—a side they would prefer not to look at.</p>

			<p>The protagonist of our story is Ushoromiya Battler, the son of Kinzo’s second son, Ushiromiya Rudolf. Battler returned to the Ushiromiya Family after six whole years, as he had a falling out with his father and had lived away from him for all these years. After returning to the island after so many years, Battler had forgotten a great deal about the island but had a great time reuniting with his cousins and reminiscing about their youth. The cousins played together into the wee hours of the night and had a lot of fun coming together after such a long time. In such a manner, the day of 4th October 1986 comes to an end.</p>

			<p>The next day, the cousins wake up to the nightmarish reality of seeing that six people they know and love have been killed in a cruel and heartless manner. Faced with this brutal reality, some grieved, and others screamed words of anger at the invisible culprit, saying they would seek vengeance on them and make them suffer a cruel fate. Battler was faced with the harsh reality of accepting that both his parents had been killed and that the murderer was hiding somewhere on this island.</p>

			<p>As the day progressed, the number of deaths kept piling up, and the survivors were plagued with distrust and suspicion. The gruesomeness and heartlessness of the crimes only added salt to Battler’s already deep wounds. The number of people he could suspect kept decreasing. Despite how hard he tried to deny it, he was tormented by the reality that one of the people he had gotten to rekindle with after such a long time could be the culprit.</p>

			<p>Battler found a way to save his fragile ego from this dilemma of distrust and hatred that was spreading among the group of survivors: just put the blame on the Golden Witch Beatrice. Despite his logical understanding that such a thing was impossible and that there was no witch, he even said so to Maria multiple times when she insisted that the Witch did all the killings. But the brutality and heartlessness of the murders made him want to refuse the idea that these murders were committed by a person. That one of the people he was so close to would commit such a tragedy. The most interesting aspect of this episode was definitely the setup for this seemingly impossible murder mystery and the psychological dilemma multiple characters were faced with. It gives the reader the <i>rawest</i> taste of one half of Umineko: <i><b>the mystery</b></i>.</p>

			<p>This tale ends with the death of all people on the island and the complete victory of the Golden Witch Beatrice. But it isn’t complete just yet. If you paid attention, the Epitaph of the Witch mentioned that once everyone died, the Golden Witch would revive and open the gates to the Golden Land, where everyone could be happy forever. Exactly such a thing happened, where the last four survivors, Battler, George, Jessica, and Maria, were revived in the Golden Land and reunited with their loved ones. All the “dead” people sat together at the table, enjoying this magical tea party, discussing their deaths with pleasant expressions on their faces with none other than the Golden Witch herself. It all seemed happy and cheery on the surface, but something felt off to Battler. The fact that everyone accepted the deaths as a work of magic by the witch Beatrice felt wrong to him, and despite seeing her in front of him, he just couldn’t accept it. And so, Battler challenged the witch to a battle to prove if she existed or not. Whether her magic was real or was an illusion to the real mystery.<br>This marks the end of the prologue.</p>

			<center><h3>Turn of the Golden Witch</h3></center>

			<h4><a href="https://imgur.com/yy3nyrE">Episode 2 Character List</a></h4>

			<p>Now that the outline of the story has been set and <i>all</i> the pieces revealed, we can finally get started with the main event. The all-out battle between Battler Ushiromiya and the Golden Witch Beatrice to prove whether the events that happened on Rokkenjima on the 5th of October 1986 were the work of a magical witch or the work of humans. To do this, Beatrice made the Rokkenjima murders into a sort of mystery puzzle, which Battler would win if he could solve the mystery of all the deaths, and Beatrice would “win” if she kept him stuck in this guessing loop forever. For this game, she introduces a new concept called the <span style="color: red">Red Truth</span>, which I will explain later.</p>

			<p>Being more or less the prologue, even in the thematic sense of the game, Episode 1 didn’t have much to give in the name of philosophical threads of thought. That becomes much more prevalent in later Episodes of Umineko, as you will soon see. The first Episode sets up a foundation to explain the basic structure of the story, which is followed in all future Episodes.</p>

			<p>But this article isn’t about discussing the mystery aspect of the story. You can find far better analysis articles and videos on the internet. I am more interested in presenting my interpretations of the philosophical themes that different episodes presented throughout their runtime and how they merge together across the Episodes. So, from this chapter on, I will spend more time exploring the thematic and philosophical aspects of the storyline.</p>

			<p>Interestingly, the Battler from the previous game is the opponent of Beatrice, who is reenacting a different iteration of the events to convince him that she and her magic exist. We see a different rendition of events from the first Episode, but they still follow the same layout as the first Episode. People start getting murdered on 5th October, and their deaths follow the Epitaph of the Golden Witch.</p>

			<p>In this Episode, we get more insight into some of the side characters in the previous Episode, such as the relationship between Rosa and her daughter, Maria. In this <a href="https://youtu.be/6XPBc3xOjLQ?si=PAThnGHsmmpMWN7P">clip</a>, you get a sense of the relationship that these two have, which I will explore in greater depth in a future Episode. We also get to see the budding romance between George and Shannon, as well as the teenage crush between Jessica and Kanon, which cannot come to fruition.</p>

			<p>Despite being the overall weakest Episode of Umineko, looking back on it, I find many aspects of it build the foundations for various themes explored in greater depth in future arcs, a common theme for the question Episodes.</p>

			<p>As a standalone Episode, the most intriguing part of this is the effects of paranoia and fear on the mind. As the day progresses and people keep getting killed, Rosa begins to slowly distrust anybody and everybody. To her, it may have felt natural to be wary so that she could protect herself and her daughter from harm’s way. But, in the process, she ended up abandoning everyone else for the flimsiest of reasons.<br>Reminds of the quote,<center><i>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.”</i></center><br>Sadly, Rosa was incapable of overcoming her fears but was instead completely swayed by them, which led her and all the survivors completely astray from the path of survival.</p>

			<center><h3>Banquet of the Golden Witch</h3></center>

			<center><img src="/assets/releases/2025-01-1/1-3.webp" alt="image" style="width: calc(min(500px, 45vw))"></center><br/>

			<h4><a href="https://imgur.com/xjb6tfO">Episode 3 Character List</a></h4>

			<p>Episode 3 focuses much more on Ushiromiya Eva, the First Daughter of Kinzo, and her struggles. Being the daughter of the Ushiromiya family is no easy task, especially for Eva, whose only desire is to be acknowledged and praised by her father, Kinzo. Sadly for Eva, Kinzo didn't deem the family head to be a role a woman is eligible for. But Kinzo is an extremely patriarchal individual who believes in tradition and that men and women have different roles in society which they cannot abandon. Despite being more capable and skilled than her older brother, Krauss, she is never allowed to display her prowess. Or rather, she is reproached for her conventionally male character traits.</p>

			<p>She is frustrated at herself and her family, and she is desperate for approval from her father and to become the future head of the family. The culmination of these negative emotions festered in her heart for years and didn’t clear away even after she became a mother and moved out of the Ushiromiya Household. These strong emotions and feelings gave birth to the persona of Eva-Beatrice, a witch who carried forth the murders of Rokkenjima in Episode 3. The dynamic of adult Eva mentally fighting against the actions of teenage Eva (Eva-Beatrice) is an interesting depiction of the “Angel vs Devil on the shoulder” and gives deep insight into Eva as a person.</p>

			<p>In the Magic world, where Battler and Beatrice are duking it out in the third game, Battler has acquired a few tools to fight against Beatrice on even terms. <span style="color: red">The Red Truth is a statement that can be used by a Witch, and it is completely true. There is no use trying to deny the red truth as it will destroy the fundamental building block of the game itself</span>. It is a very interesting mechanic, which is a <a href="https://imgur.com/96QTctf">double-edged sword</a>. The second tool Battler got was the <span style="color: blue">Blue Truth. These are statements that the human side can use to present a possible theory for the murders,</span><span style="color: red"> and they have to be denied by the Red Truth, or it is a loss for the witch.</span></p>

			<p>The final tool Battler gets comes from an unexpected place, it is from a witch, Virgilia. She is basically Beatrice’s mentor/predecessor, and she gives Battler a unique outlook on the situation when he is in dire need of help. Taking the idea from Schrodinger’s cat, she tells Battler to assume the events in the games depicted by Beatrice to be something happening inside the Cat box. The human Truth and the Witch’s Truth may exist inside the box simultaneously, which cannot be verified unless one opens the box and checks inside it. But since that isn’t possible for Battler, he can find solace in the fact that as both truths exist inside the cat box simultaneously, the validity of the Witch’s claims holds no bearing on his own claims, and his human truth will be <a href="https://imgur.com/DFs29Mm">equally valid</a>.</p>

			<p>This is a fairly interesting interpretation of Schrodinger’s cat box and opens the story to many ideas and possibilities, which are explored much more deeply in the Answer Episodes. Despite the tools Battler was given, his battles weren’t easy in the slightest. Beatrice employs various tricks, play on words, and other crafty methods to trick not just Battler but also the reader. She tries using various tools to suck the reader into her mystical world of magic and obfuscate the truth, and I, for one, fell for it hook, line, and sinker.</p>

			<p>You can’t really blame me, though. Beatrice is just too good of a character for me to ignore. Her banter and “fights” with Battler were the most entertaining and engaging sections of the Questions Episodes for me.</p>

			<center><h3>Alliance of the Golden Witch</h3></center>

			<center><img src="/assets/releases/2025-01-1/1-4.webp" alt="image" style="width: calc(min(500px, 45vw))"></center><br/>

			<h4><a href="https://imgur.com/xjb6tfO">Episode 4 Character List</a></h4>

			<p>As we progress through the episodes, the frequency and scale of the magical events keep increasing. Almost as if Battler is getting more and more acclimated to the magical phenomenon taking place around him. This Episode was a perfect example of this, where most of the October 5th battle involved various family members fighting life-or-death matches against demons and goat monsters. While this was very fun to read, to a detective, it is only muddling the truth. <span style="color: blue">One can surmise that Beatrice increases the magical elements in the story to confuse and sideline Battler so that he doesn’t win against her</span>. Too bad for her; Battler has Ange on his side this Episode.</p>

			<p>Ange Ushiromiya is the daughter of Rudolf and Kyrie Ushoromiya, as well as the younger sister of Battler Ushiromiya. She was the only member of the Ushiromiya family who wasn’t present during the Conference on Rokkenjima on the 4th and 5th of October, 1986, meaning that she is the last remaining member of the family.<br>Or so one would believe, but as it would happen, Ushiromiya Eva was the lone survivor of that incident. As the only survivor, she inherited all of Kinzo’s gold and became the new head of the family, with Ange becoming her daughter. Obviously, the suspicious nature of her survival made many speculate about the murders of Rokkenjima and if it was all carried out her Eva herself. Ange herself believed this and blamed Eva to be the murderer of her family.</p>

			<p>Many years pass, and in 1998, Eva passes away due to old age. Time had not treated her kindly, and she became a husk of her former self. Wary, paranoid, and spiteful of the entire world, especially Ange, who had survived instead of her beloved son George. She grew to resent Ange, and Ange grew to resent Eva. This mutual relationship of hatred didn’t end even after Eva died. Ange’s only purpose and mission in life is to find the <span style="color: red">truth</span> of Rokkenjima of that day in 1986.</p>

			<p>Ange gets a hold of  Maria’s diary, and through the diary, we see a tale of Maria’s life from her perspective. To Maria, she thinks she has an enjoyable life, living alone with her mother. Her mother might be very busy at work and unable to come home often, but luckily for Maria, she is a witch, and she can give souls to her toys, so she never feels lonely. She might not have any friends at school, but luckily, she can take her toy friends to school and play with them, and hey, look, she isn’t lonely anymore. Her mom may be busy at work for multiple days in a row, but atleast she comes back with gifts for Maria and treats her well, <i>usually</i>.</p>

			<p>But looking at their relation from the cold, rational mindset of an adult, all one can see is a strained relation between a daughter and her ignorant mother. While Rosa does love her daughter to some degree, she is filled with feelings of resentment for Rosa’s father for leaving her. Sometimes, she resents Maria for being born, as she is a sign of her ex, as well as a barrier for her to achieve happiness for herself as a woman, or so she believes. We see many instances of Rosa going on trips with her boyfriend while making excuses to Maria about being busy with work. And as we have seen in previous Episodes, Rosa has a habit of physically assaulting Maria whenever she gets pissed off.</p>

			<p>Even interpreting it in the nicest context, Rosa suffers from some sort of BPD, where her emotions go loose, and she becomes an evil witch. The evil witch analogy is a coping mechanism Maria uses to make sense of her mother’s bouts of rage, which is extremely depressing to see. This brings us to the most fascinating aspect of this Episode: the nature of truth.</p>

			<p>To us and Ange, it seems like Rosa is a horrible mother who doesn’t care for her daughter and leaves her alone for many days for the sake of her enjoyment. And Maria is a lonely girl whose only friends are her make-believe toy friends.<br>But to Maria, her mother is a hardworking person who works for a long time to provide for her family, and loves her daughter a lot, even when she doesn’t have the time to play. She is neither lonely nor sad, as she has the magic to birth new friends in the form of her toys, and she can play with them throughout the day. Who are we to defy her truth and call it wrong? Why does the objective truth of the situation even matter here? Who is the almighty individual that can even decide what the objective truth is? Society?<br>Rather than these pointless debates of what’s right and what isn’t, it is more important to find your own truth, which satisfies you. <span style="color: blue">If Maria’s interpretation allows her to live her day-to-day life happily, then no one has to right to deny her that</span><span style="color: #DAA520;"> truth.<br>The certainty and belief a person puts into an idea imbue it with the magic to fulfill a miracle.</span><br>Ange was able to find some sense of solace from her torture with this understanding. <span style="color: #DAA520">Even if no one else can see her magic, it still exists, and no one has the right to refuse its existence.</span><br>And with that epiphany, Ange’s tale comes to an end.<br><i>Or does it?</i></p>

			<center><h3>End of the Golden Witch</h3></center>

			<center><img src="/assets/releases/2025-01-1/1-5.webp" alt="image" style="width: calc(min(500px, 45vw))"></center><br/>

			<h4><a href="https://imgur.com/J4RBxz8">Episode 5 Character List</a></h4>

			<p>Episode 4 marked the end of the questions arcs, and supposedly, all clues and material needed to solve the mystery had been presented to the reader, as well as to Battler. But he still feels completely lost and has no clue what the solution could be. Beatrice’s non-responsiveness and the game being taken over by another witch, Lambdadelta, isn’t helping him either. But we aren’t here to focus on the game's events but rather the themes.</p>

			<p>Interestingly, Episode 5 looks into the meaning of truth from an extremely contradictory sense compared to Episode 4. In Episode 4, we came to see how the <span style="color: #DAA520">singular</span> truth that any person believes in is much more important and valuable than what people believe to be the truth.<br>In Episode 5, we are shown how if a truth is believed by the entire group, that truth rises to the status of a <span style="color: red">red truth</span>. If everyone <i>believes</i> something to be the truth, then there is no one to refuse it. If no one refuses it, it is equivalent to the <span style="color: red">absolute truth</span>.<br><span style="color: blue">People want self-satisfaction rather than the absolute truth. If something seems believable enough to be the truth and fits the people’s narratives, it is extremely convenient to consider it the </span><span style="color: red">absolute truth</span>.</p>

			<p>Natsuhi finds herself trapped in a narrative that paints her as the culprit, and she cannot prove she isn’t one. All the proof has been arranged such that the narrative forces Natsuhi to be the culprit unless an equally acceptable narrative is presented to prove her innocent. In the human world, no such convenient tool, such as the <span style="color: red">red truth</span>, exists. So the truth, which <i>seems</i> to be the truth, is granted the status of <span style="color: red">red truth</span> when the entire group accepts a narrative.</p>

			<p>The might of the masses is a strong and cruel barrier that restricts all means of escape once the masses have converged on a specific belief. There is nothing tougher than to change the collective belief of a group, as the group would rather accept a convenient truth than search deeper for a more meaningful answer.</p>

			<p><i>Without love, it cannot be seen</i>, and it is quite convenient to <span style="color: red">enforce a truth</span> without looking at the <i>heart</i> of the matter. But in the pursuit of <span style="color: red">truth</span>, is ignoring the heart, the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/whydunit">whydunit</a> of the mystery, the right thing to do?</p>

			<center><h3>Dawn of the Golden Witch</h3></center>

			<center><img src="/assets/releases/2025-01-1/1-6.webp" alt="image" style="width: calc(min(500px, 45vw))"></center><br/>

			<h4><a href="https://imgur.com/sZgH3jM">Episode 6 Character List</a></h4>

			<p>This episode is different from the previous ones in multiple ways. This time, the sides have switched, and our beloved protagonist, Battler, is the game master. He has graduated from the role of the detective and became the Game Master and the Owner of this memory fragment. The role of Detective was instead passed onto Erika Furudo, a piece of the witch Bernkastel.</p>

			<p>Also, the themes being explored in this Episode are also very different from those explored in Episodes 4 and 5. While those topics focussed more on the different interpretations of truth and how love is needed to see the truth. This Episode centers itself on the meaning and the understanding of love itself. Love can have many interpretations, which I will be exploring now.</p>

			<p>This episode examines a person’s relatively naive understanding of love and tests it to the limit. It shows how just believing in your love isn’t enough, you will have to actively fight to achieve it. You will have to be determined enough to fight down obstructions to achieving your love, and sometimes, this may involve sacrificing your loved ones.We see this when Geroge decides to kill his mother, Ushiromiya Eva, in the magic world. It is a metaphor for George deciding to leave the overprotective nest that his mother had trapped him in till now and leaving it to live a life of his own. It is a very human look into the character of George, who, before this, had always acted perfectly. It showed us his imperfections as a character and the reasons why he grew to become the seemingly perfect being that he is.</p>

			<p>Another core theme completely unrelated to the previous theme is the relationship between the reader and the writer of mystery stories. They discuss in-depth the relationship between the reader and the writer and the concessions both sides have to make in order to move the story forward. The reader has to put their faith in the author that the story is solvable. And the author puts their time and effort into writing a story, with the hopes and belief that the reader will invest their time to solve the author’s puzzle. The reader will put as much love into the mystery as the author did. This belief fuels the author to move forward. Only when the author and the reader believe in each other can a story complete its purpose. This in itself is another interpretation of love. The love shared between the author and the reader fuels the story to soar to greater heights.</p>

			<p>Finally, I would like to share my personal opinions on the Episode. This Episode is definitely the one I enjoyed the most. From start to end, the story, character interactions, and themes all created a final package that was extremely fun to read. And the last five minutes of this Episode are easily the most hype scene in the entire game, and in my top three scenes. The shameless look into the true essence of love was a perfect lead-in to Episode 7.</p>

			<center><h3>Requiem of the Golden Witch</h3></center>

			<center><img src="/assets/releases/2025-01-1/1-7.webp" alt="image" style="width: calc(min(500px, 45vw))"></center><br/>

			<h4><a href="https://imgur.com/9xu45Co">Episode 7 Character List</a></h4>

			<p>After the cheery, fun, and extravagant ending of Episode 6, this Episode takes a sharp turn to a more somber and grounded depiction. This is because it is finally time to raise the curtain on the most important question of the game, “Why was Beatrice created?”</p>

			<p>The author decided to only explain the whydunit of the culprit, and so to reveal who the culprit is. But they don’t explain how the murders in each Episode took place. This is a very important and crucial theme of this story. The author, time and time again, urges the reader to try out the riddles of the story on their own. <span style="color: blue">Rather than the answer being right or wrong, the important part is the process of engaging with the story and trying to solve its mystery</span>. Keeping in vein with this theme, the author only cares to explain the emotional reasoning behind the culprit and what their “motive” was, rather than how they carried out the crimes.</p>

			<p>The <span style="color: red">truth</span> tends to be crueler than the false stories that adorn it. The stories may even be a convenient curtain to hide the ugly truth. Still, some would say finding out the <span style="color: red">truth</span> is the right as well as the privilege of the reader. But the commonest of courtesies is not expecting the <span style="color: red">truth</span> to be pretty. Or something that falls under your understanding. The <span style="color: red">truth</span> is the truth, irrespective of your understanding of it. Thus, as readers, what we can do is calmly find out the truth and make peace with it.</p>

			<p><i>Without love, it cannot be seen</i></p>

			<p>The truth of this tale is draped with a tale of love. Love is as beautiful as it is cruel, and in this tale <span style="color: red">it had taken a person as its victim, transforming them into the Golden Witch Beatrice</span>. Beatrice was just an extremely lonely girl, and in the meta-world of the game, what she wanted was for Battler to solve her puzzle. By solving her puzzle, he could understand the core of her heart, which was her deepest desire.</p>

			<p>In the real world, the culprit was desperate and didn’t know what to do, so decided to carry out the Witch’s Epitaph to let the roulette wheel of fate decide on their fate. They had completely given up on deciding for themselves, as the choices were too hard for them, so they found it easier to let fate decide.</p>

			<p>You can understand how the real motive was much more driven by desperation and tragedy. While Beatrice’s motives were very human, the motives of the real culprit were much more grounded in reality. The cruelty and desperation of their situation made their condition more understandable. Well, as understandable as murdering all people on an island can be.</p>

			<p>And yet, this may not be the <span style="color: red">truth. A cat box adorned with multiple truths does not lead to the actual truth.</span><br>In Ange’s World of 1998, we find out that the first two Episodes of the game are well-known to the people of the world, as they had drifted onto the shores of Japan from Rokkenjima in glass bottles. These bottles contained the story of a witch Beatrice killing people in various fashions, which seems to be written by the witch Beatrice herself. After this, people started writing their own stories, reimagining the incidents of Rokkenjima. Of all these stories, the stories of <a href="https://imgur.com/n7VSUx8">Tohya Hachijo</a> seem to resemble the original stories from the bottles closely. The reader discovers that she is the writer of all Episodes after 2, including Episode 3, in which Ushoromiya Eva survived and returned from Rokkenjima. A possibility that matches closely with what happened in reality.</p>

			<p>This revelation opens a whole new possibility and interpretation of events for the reader. <span style="color: blue">It enables the possibility that all stories told to this point were just fabrications</span>, <a href="https://imgur.com/oJDKoCg">one of millions of possibilities present in the cat box that is Rokkenjima.</a> None of them are the real representation of what actually happened in Rokkenjima, but rather a convenient fantasy masking reality.</p>

			<p><span style="color: blue">While the heart of the truth may remain the same throughout all the fragments, the outcomes can vary wildly due to various circumstances, which can be seen in the varying outcomes of all the Episodes</span>. But that doesn’t mean any of them represent the <span style="color: red">truth</span>. This is a wildly interesting scenario that completely blew me away when I was reading it. It is such a unique interpretation of the basic cat box problem, and its implications throughout the story make it even more grand.</p>

			<p>The character arcs of Battler and Beatrice were concluded at the end of Episode 6.<br>The truth of the Culprit was revealed and laid to rest in Episode 7.<br>What more is left to say? What is in store for us in Episode 8?</p>

			<p>There is still one person who is not happy. Someone who hasn’t yet reached her <span style="color: #DAA520">truth</span>.<br>A young girl named Ushiromiya Ange approached Battler, asking him about the truth. She had been searching for the <span style="color: red">truth</span> her whole life and had made it her mission in life to achieve it. Since the Rokkenjima Massacres of 1986, 12 years may have passed, but she has still not moved on from that time. Even in 1998, the 18-year-old Ange is still a young child, searching for her family.<br>This is the tale of her journey.</p>

			<h4><a href="https://imgur.com/VOwjZXq">Episode 8 Character List</a></h4>

			<p>Ange has spent all her life pursuing the <span style="color: red">one absolute truth</span> that would explain the Rokkenjima Massacre. This pursuit of truth slowly changed from a pursuit to a desperate attempt to validate her belief that Ushiromiya Eva was the culprit. After all this searching, when she finally went to Battler in search of that truth, she expected to finally be able to find out the truth and go to sleep, forever.</p>

			<p>But what awaited her was completely outside of her expectations. All the people she thought she knew, through the tales she had read in the various Episodes, were completely different here. Her stern grandfather, who was supposed to be extremely cruel, turned out to be a doting grandfather who loved his grandchildren and celebrated Halloween with them during the annual family conference. The siblings, who were supposed to be money-hungry vultures who schemed against each other, actually respected and cared for each other. This was a Rokkenjima that she had never seen or even imagined. Being so out of her range of expectations, she couldn’t even start to believe that this was <span style="color: red">the truth</span> of that day in 1986.</p>

			<p>This presented us with a very interesting theory. All the people that we, and Ange, know from Rokkenjima are just <span style="color: blue">characters in the tales of various people. None of them were the actual people. And since Ange only knew them when she was young, she must have forgotten most things about them.</span> It was possible that her grandfather was a strict person, but he could also be someone who adored his grandchildren. <span style="color: blue">The truth of Rokkenjima was written over by the truth of the stories and opinions of the people in the future.</span> It is easier to assume that the members of the Rokkenjima family are all scheming individuals rather than them being good people. And so the future rewrote their personality and character. And the ignorant child Ange was none the wiser.</p>

			<p>While Ange wanted to single-mindedly pursue the truth, Battler wanted to teach her a more important lesson.<br>Does the red truth even matter? Why do the actual events of Rokkenjima on 5th October 1986 even matter? <span style="color: red">It cannot affect the Ange of the future, and it will not bring her any happiness knowing it.</span> It is an extremely minute thing that can be ignored for more important things. Even if this cruel world has taken away her happiness and all reasons for her to live, she can <span style="color: #DAA520">create her own reason</span>. Whether it is the absolute belief that her family is alive somewhere or that they are living their life happily in the magic world, <span style="color: #DAA520">Ange can craft her own truth with the power of belief</span>, and no one will be capable of breaking her truth. Even the <span style="color: red">red truth of the masses, of certainty</span>, has no power over the <span style="color: #DAA520">Gold Truth</span> of belief. The ability to create her own happiness, and her own reason for living, is what makes Ange a witch.</p>

			<p>I don’t think I was able to convey everything that I wanted to convey. My prose is not skilled enough to achieve that task. But I do hope that I was able to convey the few things that I needed to. This piece was as much of a journey of self-understanding as it was a breakdown of the story itself. This piece of fiction spoke many truths that I hold close to my heart and I found it to resonate closely with me. Whether I was able to convey that, only you, the reader, would know that.</p>

			<p>I hope that this <i>short</i> article piqued your interest in this relatively unpopular series and made you want to experience it for yourself. If you think that I have explained most of the things in this story, you will be gravely mistaken. All I tried to convey was the potential of this series, even with my subpar interpretation skills. It is an extremely deep and multi-faceted story that expresses various truth and theories every time someone experiences this story. For reference, I haven’t explored any aspect of the mystery of this murder-mystery story.<br>If you are interested to the read the story, but are intimidated by the length, The <a href="https://anilist.co/manga/33749/Umineko-no-Naku-Koro-ni-Episode-1-Legend-of-the-Golden-Witch/">manga</a> is a perfect place to start with. It has stellar art, and is a <i>mostly</i> faithful adaptation of the story.</p>

			<p>If you have stuck with my ramblings till the very end, I would like to convey my gratitude, I would be extremely pleased to hear of your opinions regarding it. Be it positive or negative.</p>
