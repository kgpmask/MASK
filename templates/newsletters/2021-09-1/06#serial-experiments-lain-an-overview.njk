			<p>Directed by Ryūtarō Nakamura, Serial Experiments Lain had its first episode aired on July 6, 1998. Running only for 13 episodes, the show presents a new but interesting plot along with unique art designs and soundtrack.</p>
			<p>The story starts by introducing us to the main character Lain Iwakura, an adolescent girl who lives with her family in suburban Japan. Being introverted, she doesn’t have a lot of friends and she only talks to her acquaintances. Things were running smoothly until one day she receives a mail from Chisa Yomoda, a student of her own school who had committed suicide a few days ago. Not very comfortable with technology, Lain still opens that mail out of curiosity and comes to know that Chisa was still alive inside the Wired and had only given up her physical body. The fictitious concept of Wired is very similar to that of the modern day ‘Internet’. Naturally intrigued, she decides to learn more about the Wired and asks her father to buy her a new Navi, which is basically a hypermodern computer.</p>
			<p>The storyline becomes complicated soon after explaining the basic background of the characters. We see Lain getting well versed with using Navi and the Wired. The Wired, just like the ‘Internet’, made people addicted to it. Kids using the Wired soon get involved in augmented reality games like PHANTOMa, which involve harming others, just for the sake of following the Wired. Some drove themselves to the point that they wanted to terminate their physical existence completely, existing only inside the Wired. This wasn’t possible but Lain, surprisingly, was able to do it. This made her special, as she was able to traverse across both realms. Interestingly, Lain inside the Wired had a completely opposite personality than her physical world counterpart.</p>
			<p>Along with the plot, the show builds upon the philosophical aspect of the characters and their personalities. The concepts of self-existence and self-identities are regularly highlighted. The episodes gradually shift more towards focusing on the ideologies that Lain believes in, as well as the conflicting implications they have on her. The later part of the show presents us with a few subplots which can be very simple or deeply philosophical, depending on how the viewer interprets it.</p>
			<p>The reason that the show shines out is its relevance to modern times. Internet addiction is an actual thing today, which was predicted by the show back in 1998. The ideas of physical harm inflicting augmented games sound eerily similar to the 2016 incident of the Blue Whale Challenge. The fact that people have a different personality over the Internet than their real self, isn’t unrealistic at all. Like every anime with a non-conventional storyline, the viewers of this show are divided into two distinct camps. Some completely dismiss the show, calling it pretentious while there are some who declare it a masterpiece. But one cannot deny the fact that the show has successfully managed to stay relevant even to this day, 23 years after its release. The themes portrayed are very realistic and the show still continues to attract ‘experimental’ and ‘alternative’ anime enthusiasts.</p>
