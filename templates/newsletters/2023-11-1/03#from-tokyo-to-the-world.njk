			<p>The popularity of anime in recent years has led to a growing interest in adapting Western cartoons into anime-style series. Some reasons:- </p>

			<h2>Piracy and its significant effects </h3>
			<br/>
			
			<p>Anime can be watched on many websites and apps; some are legal, and some are illegal, but People often watch anime on illegal websites because… yah, you guessed it right, it's free, and because of this, there are two faces of effects of piracy, positive and negative one. </p>

			<h3>Positive effects</h4>
			<br/>
			<ul>

			<br/>

			<h3>Negative effects</h4>
			<br/>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Revenue loss-</b> Piracy can lead to significant revenue loss for anime studios, distributors, and creators, impacting their ability to produce new content </li>
				<li><b>Exposure-</b> Anime piracy can negatively affect the livelihood of creators and discourage them from producing new content. </li>
			</ul>
			<br/>

			<p>In conclusion, anime piracy is a double-edged sword that affects both fans and the industry. While it provides accessibility and exposure, it also leads to revenue loss and legal concerns for creators and distributors.</p>
