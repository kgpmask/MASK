			<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p>As a medium, Manga is as diverse as the audiences it caters to, with two of its most prominent genres being shonen and seinen. While shonen is often associated with fast-paced action, youthful protagonists, and themes of growth and friendship, seinen delves into mature narratives, complex characters, and philosophical undertones. These genres represent different target demographics and embody distinct storytelling approaches that have shaped the evolution of manga. But there is one manga that caters to both and has managed to pull it off perfectly to become one of the best and most reputed manga ever.</p>

			<h3>Steel Ball Run</h3>

			<p><i>Jojo’s Bizzare Adventure: Steel Ball Run</i>, written by Hirohiko Araki, is often regarded as the most incredible work of fiction in the 21st century, and for good reasons. Being a culmination of both  Shonen and Seinen, it ideally provides the best of both sides and is a must-read for any reader. The anime will be released shortly in the Summer of 2025, so right now is the perfect time to take interest and dive into the world of Steel Ball Run.</p>

			<p>This article will focus on how Steel Ball Run takes the best of both worlds and is able to create a masterpiece that is appreciated by many.</p>

			<p><b>Warning: Spoilers ahead; please go through the manga to enjoy your life to the fullest.</b></p>

			<h3>Shonen</h3>

			<p>The <i>shonen</i> genre, aimed primarily at a younger male audience, is characterized by its focus on action, adventure, and themes of growth and perseverance. Protagonists aim to achieve their dreams, encountering a series of challenges in their adventure. Common tropes like the power of friendship, willpower and determination, and the ideology of never giving up are prevalent among shonen mangas.  Some popular examples of <i>shonen</i> may include <i>Dragon Ball, Bleach, and Demon Slayer</i>.</p>

			<h4>Shonen in Steel Ball Run</h4>

			<p>The story follows a young boy named Johnny Joestar, who once was a successful horse jockey but soon encountered troubles after getting shot in the spine and developing paraplegia. Before the Steel Ball Run race begins, he encounters Gyro Zeppeli and his steel balls. After coming into contact with Gyro’s balls, he was able to temporarily gain strength in his legs, which shocked him and made him very curious about finding out the power behind those balls. Thus, a dream is born of participating in the Steel Ball Run race and winning it to discover the truth behind the mystery.</p>

			<center><small><i>This story is the tale of me starting to walk. Not in the physical sense…</i></small></center>
			<center><small><i>but in an adolescence-to adulthood-sort of way… - <b>Johnny Joestar</b></i></small></center><br>

			<p><i>Gyro</i> agrees to help <i>Johnny</i> achieve his goal and claims to perceive a “dark determination” in <i>Johnny</i> that makes him prioritize his goal over anything else, disregarding any risk or consequences that he may come across.</p>

			<p>The whole story takes place simultaneously with the ongoing <i>Steel Ball Run</i> race, where <i>Gyro</i> and <i>Johnny</i> face challenges at every moment of their journey, pursuing their primary goal while competing in the race as well.</p>

			<p>As synonymous with other parts of <i>Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure</i>, part 7: <i>Steel Ball Run</i> continues the usage of <i>stands</i> and also incorporates a new concept of <i>spin, creating</i> a new power dynamic from part 7 onwards. Part 7 is the beginning of a new universe completely different from the previous parts, and the successive parts, like Jojolion and JOJOLands, follow the world of <i>Steel Ball Run.</i></p>

			<p>The most fantastic part of <i>Steel Ball Run</i> would be the side characters and the overall character development of every significant character in the series. From the likes of <i>Johnny, Gyro, and Diego</i> to <i>Funny Valentine, Lucy Steel</i>, and, of course, we can’t forget <i>Jesus Joestar</i>. That reminds me that it is Christmas while I am writing this article. So <b>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone</b> reading this, and let’s continue forward.</p>

			<p><i>Johnny</i>, intrigued by the power of <i>spin</i>, takes lessons from <i>Gyro</i> throughout his journey to reach the “truth”. During this process, he is able to conjure his own <i>stand</i> called <i>Tusk</i>, which has the power to shoot nail bullets at enemies incorporated with <i>spin</i>. They discover various corpse parts scattered across the route of the <i>Steel Ball Run</i> and suspect that the “truth” will be uncovered once they find all the corpse parts and that whoever is overseeing this race also wants their hand on the “truth”. And that’s when we encounter the best antagonist that could possibly exist, <i>Funny Valentine</i>, who has one of the most potent stand abilities, <i>Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap</i>.</p>

			<p>Throughout the series, <i>Johnny</i> and <i>Diego</i> develop a sense of rivalry. They are very similar in that they won’t hesitate on anything if it means they can achieve their own goals. <i>Johnny</i> always had that dark determination that he would not hesitate to kill. At the same time, <i>Diego</i> is an opportunist, which is showcased when he allies with <i>Funny Valentine</i> to kill <i>Johnny</i>, even though he was well aware of <i>Funny Valentine</i>’s personality and the threat he posed to him, but in the end, the alliance proves futile.</p>

			<center><small><i>Gyro, for this reason… this was the reason for “lesson 5”. Thank you… Thank you, Gyro.</i></small></center>
			<center><small><i>I truly… truly… thank you… I can’t find any other words to express it. - <b>Johnny Joestar</b></i></small></center><br>

			<p>Perhaps the most shocking thing that has happened in <i>Steel Ball Run</i> would be the introduction of an <i>alternate Diego</i> with a completely different <i>stand</i> from the one possessed by the <i>Diego</i> of this world. <i>Diego</i> had stolen one of the corpse parts and fused it with his left eye, turning himself into a dinosaur. While initially benefiting from enhanced senses and strength, the Stand and its abilities eventually became his own, also known as <i>Scary Monsters</i>. In the parallel world, <i>Diego</i> was much crueler and more violent than the original <i>Diego</i> and had a much stronger stand, famously known by many as <i>THE WORLD</i>.</p>

			<p><i>Johnny Joestar’s</i> character development, along with the development of his <i>stand</i> powers are evident throughout the series. While he was very depressed and lacked confidence at the beginning of the Steel Ball Run race, as the race progressed, he gained back his self-esteem and strengthened his resolve to fight for his motive. The key steps of his progress include Johnny discovering the Corpse (ACT1), then standing up for himself against Soundman (ACT2), symbolically cleansing himself of his guilt against Axl RO and being blessed by Jesus's apparition (ACT3), and finally acquiring the Corpse and regaining the use of his legs (ACT4).</p>

			<h3>Seinen</h3>

			<p>The seinen genre, targeted primarily at adult male audiences, is characterized by its mature themes, complex narratives, and nuanced character development. It often explores philosophical, psychological, and societal issues, delving into morality, existentialism, and the human condition. Seinen stories frequently feature realistic settings, morally ambiguous characters, and a focus on the consequences of actions, creating a grounded and introspective tone. Notable examples like <i>Berserk</i>, <i>Monster</i>, and <i>Vagabond</i> showcase the depth and sophistication that define the seinen genre.</p>

			<h4>Seinen in Steel Ball Run</h4>

			<p>The intricacies of Seinen are deeply enrooted in the characters themselves. Their backstories give the reasoning for their actions and, combined with their goals and perception of the world, creates a vastly dynamic and nuanced interaction between the characters.</p>

			<p>We are introduced to <i>Gyro Zeppeli</i> from the beginning and learn that he is an executioner hailing from the Kingdom of Naples. He joins the <i>Steel Ball Run</i> race to win amnesty for a child he is assigned to execute. For him, winning the race is the ultimate motive, and he looks down on everyone else, mocking and insulting them. <i>Gyro</i> gains respect for <i>Johnny</i> once he is exposed to his determination and resolve. Despite their opposing personalities, they considered each other as valuable allies and were ready to save the others’ life in their stead anytime. <i>Gyro</i>'s continuous support helped <i>Johnny</i> get out of his depression and enabled him to begin anew. Throughout their journey, they discover each other's secrets and thus build an unbreakable bond of blood and brotherhood.</p>

			<p>There were multiple instances where <i>Johnny’s</i> and <i>Gyro’s</i> resolve were questioned. Against their fight with <i>Ringo Roadagain</i>, they faced a dilemma where they couldn’t escape without killing him. He had incapacitated <i>Johnny</i> as he was a serious threat and wouldn’t hesitate to finish him off. He possessed a stand that could rewind time, and it was challenging to subdue him, but in the end, <i>Gyro</i> had to make a decision, and thus, for the first time in his life, <i>Gyro</i> had killed someone and took a step closer to entering A <i>True Man’s World</i>.</p>

			<center><img src="/assets/releases/2025-01-1/2-4.webp" alt="image" style="width: calc(min(500px, 45vw))"></center><br/>

			<center><small><i>This is the world of man. Do you want to condemn it as backwards?</i></small></center>
			<center><small><i>This world that we live in…. It seems as if our values are leaning heavily towards</i></small></center>
			<center><small><i>one of spoiled indifference. - <b>Ringo Roadagain</b></i></small></center><br>

			<p>Another instance was when they encountered <i>Civil War</i>, a <i>stand</i> whose whole existence is to control people’s guilt to attack them. As such, it is a perfect example of a <i>stand</i> that affects you mentally and psychologically. Even when <i>Johnny</i> killed <i>Axl RO</i>, the user of the <i>stand</i>, he was instantly revived just because <i>Johnny</i> felt guilt for killing him. Such was the potency of this <i>stand</i>. This was also when <i>Johnny</i> unlocked his <i>Tusk ACT3</i>, enabling him to handle the situation and escape death yet again.</p>

			<p><i>Diego Brando</i>, more commonly known as <i>DIO</i>, is an example of an antagonistic character that isn’t particularly villainous. His history and backstory heavily influence his goals and motives throughout the story, and he takes every necessary step to achieve them. Since childhood, he witnessed the horrors surrounding him and his mother. One instance would be when they didn’t have a cup to claim the stew being distributed to the farmhands, so she was served the scalding stew in her hands to feed her son. Seeing her mother sacrifice her hands just to feed him brought tears to his eyes, and from then on, he developed a strong sense of pride following his mother’s example. After the death of his mother, he grew up resenting and looking down on everyone and vowed to take any steps necessary to fulfill his goals and exact revenge against society.</p>

			<p>In the <i>Steel Ball Run</i> race, we observe that <i>Diego</i> always tries to sabotage <i>Johnny</i> and <i>Gyro</i>, and thus, he is portrayed as an antagonist. Still, I believe he is an independent character who acts in his best interests and is ready to follow any path that guarantees success. Although he couldn’t achieve his goals in the end, he still preserved his pride and morals and died with them, which is a testament to his unwavering belief in himself and the values he upholds as an individual.</p>

			<p>There is one character in <i>Steel Ball Run</i> who is blessed by <i>Jesus</i>, literally. <i>Lucy Steel</i>, just 14 at the time of <i>Steel Ball Run</i>, married to <i>Steven Steel</i>, the promoter of the <i>Steel Ball Run</i> race is whom I consider to be one of the main protagonists since without her, <i>Johnny</i> and <i>Gyro</i> would never know about <i>Funny Valentine</i> and all their efforts would be futile and for lost cause. She is the one who finds out about <i>Funny Valentine’s</i> plans and even throws herself into danger by infiltrating <i>Funny Valentine’s</i> mansion, disguising herself as his wife and with the help of <i>Hot Pants’</i> help, even killing her. She also has several perilous encounters against <i>Stand</i> users such as <i>Blackmore</i>, <i>Mike O.</i>, or even <i>Diego Brando</i>, all of whom try to kill her. <i>Lucy</i> is ultimately the one who defeats <i>Diego Brando</i> by bringing his alternate self's head to him, killing him. Despite her gentle nature, <i>Lucy</i> also doesn't hesitate to fire at <i>Blackmore</i> or stab <i>Valentine</i>, showing a hidden ruthless side to her.</p>

			<p><i>Lucy</i> exhibits courage, resilience, and compassion in her actions and becomes the prime target for <i>Funny Valentine</i> to exploit her since she has the blessings of <i>Jesus</i> himself. Needless to say, <i>Lucy Steel</i> is probably one of my favorite characters from <i>Steel Ball Run</i>, and her appearance in <i>Jojolion</i> makes me even happier, but that is a story for another day.</p>

			<center><small><i>My body is being replaced with something else... Th... The Corpse... Am…</i></small></center>
			<center><small><i>Am I going to turn into the Corpse? - <b>Lucy Steel</b></i></small></center><br>

			<p>Last but not least, we have <i>Jesus Joestar</i>. Yes, a literal God is related to the <i>Joestars</i>, and the whole purpose of <i>Funny Valentine</i> for conducting the <i>Steel Ball Run</i> race was to find his corpse parts to revive him to obtain immortality for himself and make America great again. Although not much is discussed about him, it was clearly evident that he and <i>Lucy Steel</i> were the main trigger for the events that had conspired in <i>Steel Ball Run</i>.</p>

			<h3>Brief Conclusion</h3>

			<p>While the story plot and the journey of <i>Johnny Joestar</i> and <i>Diego Brando</i> create a background for shonen, characters like <i>Lucy Steel</i> and <i>Funny Valentine</i> provide a unique twist to the story in terms of philosophical and psychological manifestation of their goals, adding the aspect of Seinen to <i>Steel Ball Run</i>. There are various <i>stands</i> and <i>stand users</i> who bring out the change in our main characters. At the same time, throughout the story, a complicated chain of power dynamics gives rise to different alliances, some volatile while some intense.</p>

			<p>In conclusion, <i>Steel Ball Run</i> masterfully blends Shonen's energetic and action-driven elements with the depth and maturity of seinen storytelling. Its dynamic character growth, thrilling battles, and themes of perseverance resonate with Shonen fans, while its exploration of morality, human ambition, and philosophical undertones appeal to a Seinen audience. This seamless fusion not only broadens its appeal but also cements its place as a groundbreaking work that transcends traditional genre boundaries, making it a standout in the world of manga.</p>

			<p>Alright, that concludes my article. Thank you for spending your time to read such a big article on <i>Steel Ball Run</i>, although I would argue that it was a good use of your time. I expect everyone to read the manga or just wait for the anime, which will be released shortly, because <i>Steel Ball Run</i> is definitely worth a read/watch for all age groups and races.</p>
