			<p>Kimetsu No Yaiba Kimetsu no Yaiba is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Koyoharu Gotouge. This was the author's first serialization. It has two manga spin-offs, created by different authors, depicting events related to other characters which occur before the beginning of the manga. Before this, the author had published 4 one-shot works, the first one of which, Kagarigari, served as a basis for Kimestsu no Yaiba. It was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump February 15, 2016, to May 18, 2020 in Japan. It is available in digital form on VIZâ€™s website and translated into English. Being a traditional manga it is predominantly available in black and white, but some chapters contain coloured opening panels. </p>
			<p>The story takes place in the Taisho-era of Japan. In this world, the demons prowl in darkness and devour the humans they come across, sometimes turning humans into demons. A secret organisation going by the name of Demon Slayer Corps, has been fighting the demons for centuries - which can only be killed by sunlight or the poison of wisteria flower. Conveniently, there is an ore which absorbs sunlight, and Nichirin blades are forged from this ore, allowing demon slayers to kill demons by cutting their head off. The demon slayers employ different breathing techniques, to empower their attacks and make their body stronger to fight the demons, who have superhuman strength, speed and regeneration - and stronger demons possess their own magic, called blood demon arts.</p>
			<p>The story follows the adventures of Kamado Tanjirou, who joins the Demon Slayer Corps after his family is murdered by a demon and his sister is turned into one. Even though the story follows a standard pattern, since it is not a very long running manga, it is packed with surprises and is an engaging read. From the beginning the plot unravels quickly, with the events setting up the recruitment of Tanjirou into the Demon Slayer Corps in the first chapter only. The pacing of the story is really good for the most part, without any stretched plot lines or filler. The action content of the manga is high, but there are also some excellent emotional moments that even make you sympathise for the demons. Demons in this manga are more complex than you are first made to believe, sometimes making you rethink your image of them. Sympathy is one of the main themes depicted by the plot, even for demons. One point worth mentioning about the plot is that the manga does not suffer from power level inconsistencies. It is a pleasant surprise to not have to swallow random changes in power levels like many other manga. Once a certain power hierarchy is established, it remains in place throughout the story.</p>
			<p>The characters are interesting and you can relate to some of them, but you might find the main character to be a bit boring if a goody-two-shoes is not your cup of tea. Characters other than the protagonist are also given proper development in the story, and that says a lot as it is filled with a sizable amount of characters for such a short manga. But if you enjoy stories in which even the less relevant characters are fleshed out, then this will be a big disappointment for you. In this manga for most part, the characters relevant to the fights are given much more attention than even allies on the sidelines. The history of the other members of the demon slayer corps, even the organization itself are overlooked  in favour of the current demon slayers themselves. But apart from this, the characters are given interesting arcs depicting their motivations, goals etc - even for the demons.</p>
			<p>One part where this manga falls short is in the art department. Compared to a few of its contemporaries in the action segments only, like One Punch Man and Vinland Saga, the art is at best mediocre. If you are dejected by lackluster art, this manga might not be up your alley. This is in striking contrast to its anime counterpart, with superb visuals by Ufotable . However, it is not terrible, and as the manga progresses, the artwork becomes better. Apart from art, the other aspects like panelling and flow are handled well and lend to a pleasant reading experience.</p>
			<p>To sum it up, the story is concise and doesn't wander off the path from start to end, the characters are interesting, power scaling is consistent and the flow of the story is smooth. Reading Kimetsu no Yaiba is an enjoyable experience if you are fine with average art at the beginning.</p>
