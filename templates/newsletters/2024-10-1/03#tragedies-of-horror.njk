			<p>The world of anime has a lot of genres to choose from, like Shounen, Seinen, Isekai, etc. Of course, these are just the popular ones, but countless other genres don’t get the attention they deserve. The genre of Horror is widely assumed to be associated with ghosts and supernatural creatures, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Most people do not know which anime are even classified as horror, so here are a few examples of such: </p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>&emsp;1. Made in Abyss</p></li>

				<li><p>&emsp;2. Monster</p></li>

				<li><p>&emsp;3. Elfen Lied</p></li>

				<li><p>&emsp;4. Attack on Titan</p></li>
			</ul><br/>

			<p>In fact, the Horror genre in anime has hardly anything to do with being scary; rather, it is an expression of tragedy and horrific events that take part in the storytelling. There are a few examples where the essence of Horror, as assumed by the masses is considered, i.e., the presence of ghosts. Ghost Stories and Mieruko-chan are good examples of this, but they are hardly scary. </p>
			
			<p>As mentioned, events that can be considered horror include tragedy and psychological horror will be the focal point of this article using Monster as the core. </p>
			
			<h4>The following analysis on Monster will contain heavy spoilers, so read further accordingly.</h4>

			<p><b>Monster</b> is an anime series about Dr. Kenzo Tenma, a well-known neurosurgeon with a promising career in a leading German hospital. Tenma puts his reputation and bright future in jeopardy to save the life of Johan, a young kid who is gravely injured. Soon after, a series of odd and enigmatic killings start to happen, with him being the main suspect.</p>
			
			<p>His previous decision plagues Tenma, and becomes persuaded that Johan is the "Monster" he created. He sets out on a mission to expose Johan's criminal history and bring him to justice. As Tenma goes deeper into discovering the truth about Johan, he becomes entangled in a labyrinth of conspiracy, political intrigue, and moral quandaries.</p>
			
			<p>At the start of the series, Dr. Tenma is faced with a pivotal and unprecedented decision to save a little boy of no known significance or the Mayor. He is cornered into a tight situation where every authority present in the hospital, including the Director, wants him to operate on the Mayor.  At this moment, Dr. Tenma realizes the weight of the words, “Some lives are more important than others.” From here onwards, Dr. Tenma loses everything he had: his career, social standing, and girlfriend,  he is soon left all alone, just him and the boy he saved.</p>
			
			<p>Upon facing this tragedy, Tenma affirms that others were only chasing behind money and not following the Doctor’s duty. He expresses his anger in front of the boy, glorifying his strong conviction of following what’s right according to his belief. Deep down he also had this feeling that he may have been escaping the guilt by creating his pretentions as he could not answer the questions raised at him. While expressing his anger, he said many things like wishing death upon them and considering himself righteous.</p>
			
			<p>After losing everything, he develops a grudge against the people who are the reason for his downfall. Unbeknownst to his surprise, all the people he had a grudge against died simultaneously, while the boy and his twin sister went missing at the same time. A few years later, the event occurs again, and this time he finds Johan, and he is shocked by the fact that it was Johan who was behind the murders. The weight of his decision hits him, and he finds himself in a tragic situation, contemplating if he was right or wrong to save Johan.</p>
			
			<p>Johan explains that he kills anyone who tries to uncover his identity but he feels that Dr. Tenma is like a father to him so he got rid of the people that Dr. Tenma wished death upon as a repayment for saving his life.</p>

			<p>Nina Fortner (later revealed to be Anna Liebert) had her fair share of tragedies thanks to Johan. Dr. Tenma, after his encounter with Nina, soon learns about the events Nina has experienced about how a young Johan killed people.</p>

			<p>Detectives believed Tenma was responsible for all the killings, so they pursued him, forcing him to work as a doctor on the black market. When he discovers that no one is prepared to leave him alone, he sets out to identify the person responsible and discovers Kinderheim 511, a covert abandoned project.</p>

			<p>It is inconceivable how vicious Kinderheim 511 can be.The goal of this orphanage was to produce emotionally-devoid superhuman troops to fight for Soviet East Germany. The youngsters were maintained on a thread for survival and were not even granted the most basic human rights.Johan was one of the test volunteers in this institution. The children were subjected to a number of ludicrously cruel tests, and in these situations, deaths were not unusual. Even with all the other children here, Johan was a threat. He had managed to control everyone in the building, and when the pandemonium turned into a slaughter, people began murdering one another.</p>

			<p>Johan only responded, "I threw an oil-soaked cloth into the open fire," when questioned about his activities. He claimed that all factions were already experiencing tremendous tensions and that all he had done was add oil to fan the flames. Kinderheim 511 was quickly shut down, and all of its records were destroyed in the fire, leaving no trace of the horrors that had taken place there. </p>
			
			<p>There are other characters in the series who, like Johan, possess a manipulative nature. For example, Roberto, initially one of Johan’s bodyguards, and also acclaimed to be Johan’s most fervent follower was also one of Kinderheim 511’s alumni. He liked to intimidate people like Johan and use them for his own benefits while leaving them to suffer.Similarly, Heinrich Runge, the officer who was on the tail of Johan from the beginning, believing him to be the ultimate culprit, had a similar code of conduct to those mentioned above. He is ruthless in his dedication to catching criminals no matter at what cost even if it is his life. To predict a killer's motives, method of execution, and his next move, Runge enters a psychological state where he "becomes" the killer. After getting into their mindset, he can reenact the killer's behavior and fully understand why they carried out such actions and what they will do next. When he tries to do this with Johan, he concludes that "I do not exist", because Johan's motives are completely impalpable to him, giving him, in Runge's eyes, a fictitious air.</p>

			<p>Miloš was one of the children who used to live with Mikhail Petrov. Mikhail continued his experiments on children as he did in Kinderheim 511, but instead of cruelty and violence, they were being loved and taken care of. He soon encounters a blonde lady (Johan cross-dressing), and Miloš, when asked what he is looking for, replies that he is searching for this mother. Johan gaslights the boy into believing that this world is insignificant and persuades him to go look for his mom in the red-light district. To the boy’s horrors all he experienced there was hell on Earth and it wasn’t until Grimmer’s intervention that he finally escaped it.</p>

			<p>Red Rose Mansion was a secluded estate, isolated from the outside world where experiments involved children subjected to extreme psychological and physical conditions with the goal of producing a child who possessed exceptional intelligence and abilities.</p>
			
			<p>The Eugenics Experiment was a project set up by Franz Bonaparta with the help of Peter Capek where men and women Would coincidentally ting and fall in love. Later, they would be separated, and the women would be sent to an isolated facility after giving birth. After breastfeeding was over, the children would be taken away and the women would be brainwashed and would not remember anything about this incident.</p>

			<p>Following the birth of the twins, Johan and Anna Liebert, they had participated in the Three Frogs experiment, in which they were both clothed as girls and brought up as such. The objective was to determine whether the mother in this instance exhibited any bias and what she would do if asked to give away one of the children.</p>

			<p>This experiment was so deeply enrooted in the twins’ minds that they couldn’t differentiate who experienced what. Nina believes that she was the one who experienced all the atrocities that Johan claims to have experienced and so on. They were practically indistinguishable when dressed identically, so no one is aware as to who was sent away but as we know, Nina feels it’s she who was sent away. It was also said that both of them don’t have any names and their current names are just placeholders. There was also a scene while leaving Czechoslovakia, where both of them refer to each other as Johan since that’s what they believe.</p>

			<p>In the final arc, we witness a confrontation between Dr. Tenma and Johan Liebert alongside Nina and Franz Bonnaparta. Nina tells Johan that he will be forgiven but Johan claims that it’s already too late. Finally, Johan gets shot in the head and falls. Similar to what happened in the beginning, Dr. Tenma saves Johan’s life again.</p>

			<p>These were a few of the accounts cited in Monster regarding the strange and tragic events witnessed by those who have had a close relation to or even encountered Johan even if for just once. Johan always asserted that “there was a Monster inside me.” The phrase was never made clear as to whether Johan has Dissociative Identity Disorder or not. It could be quite possible as hinted by the Three Frogs event where Anna and Johan are indistinguishable and their thoughts get entangled with one another similarly. In his final moments, before almost dying, he had said <b>“The only thing all humans are equal in… is death.”</b> in quite the tragic sense, in the sense that if Dr. Tenma hadn’t saved his life again, his death would be as ordinary as it gets, proving his point. When Dr. Tenma visits Vera Cerna, the mother of the twins, she asks him if he wants to know the real names of the two kids. She questions herself as to who was the real Monster all along, Franz Bonnaparta for initiating all of this, or Johan for what he did later. When Dr. Tenma passes on the same information to Johan he asks him one and only one question, “Who do you think was unwanted? Was my mother trying to protect me or did she confuse me for my sister?”</p>

			<p>The story ends here and we are left with many questions that are simply left unexplained. In my opinion, that keeps it more interesting and open for debate as multiple scenarios could have unfolded. Overall, the <b>Monster</b> is a good read/watch for anyone interested in psychological, tragedy, or horror and is a classic series in the world of anime.</p>
