			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the anime and manga series "</span><strong>Your Lie in April</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">," the theme of incomplete love is central and recurring. The series explores the idea that love isn't always enough, and that there are outside factors that keep two people apart. "</span><strong>Your Lie in April</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">" characters each have their own experiences with incomplete love, and the series uses their journeys to illuminate the complex nature of love and its many facets.</span></p>
			<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unrequited love is a prominent form of incomplete love in the series. The main character, </span><strong>Kōsei Arima</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has strong feelings for </span><strong>Kaori Miyazono</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but she is unable to reciprocate his feelings due to her own personal struggles and limitations. Kōsei's experience with unrequited love serves as a reminder that not all love stories end joyfully, and that the person we love may not always love us back. This unfulfilled love causes heartbreak for both Kōsei and Kaori, as they struggle to accept their feelings and find a way forward.</span></p>
			<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In "</span><strong>Your Lie in April</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">" another type of incomplete love is love that is never fully realized due to external factors. Kaori's health issues, for example, prevent her from fully embracing her feelings for Kōsei, while Kōsei's own emotional issues prevent him from fully opening up to Kaori. These external factors serve to emphasize the idea that love is not always enough, and that there are often other forces at work that keep two people apart.</span></p>
			<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incomplete love can also be seen in the relationships of the series' other characters.</span><strong> Tsubaki Sawabe</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, has feelings for Kōsei but is unable to confess her feelings due to her own insecurities and fears. Tsubaki suffers heartbreak as a result of her incomplete love, as she must accept the possibility that her love will never be fully realized.</span></p>
			<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the heartbreak and disappointment of the love stories in "</span><strong>Your Lie in April</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">," the series emphasizes the idea that love can still have a profound impact on our lives. The series demonstrates through Kōsei and Kaori's relationship that love can be a source of comfort, support, and healing, even if it is never fully realized. Furthermore, the series investigates the concept of incomplete love as a catalyst for growth and change, assisting us in better understanding ourselves and the world around us.</span></p>
			<p><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><strong>Your Lie in April</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">" is a heartfelt and thought-provoking series that explores the theme of incomplete love. Whether it is unrequited love or love that is never fully realized due to external factors, the series demonstrates that love is not always enough, and that there are often other forces at work that keep two people apart. It also emphasizes the idea that love can have a profound impact on our lives even if it is never fully realized, and that it can be a source of comfort, support, and healing. Whether you like anime, music, or just good storytelling, it is a series that will stick with you.</span></p>
