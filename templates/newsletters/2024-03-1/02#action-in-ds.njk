			<h3> Introduction </h3>

			<p>We all have heard of Kimetsu No Yaiba. Does the name not ring a bell? Well, you must have heard of its alternate name, Demon Slayer, then. Yes, the oh-so-popular anime, famous among the new generation of viewers and long-time fans of anime for its animation, animated by Ufotable so well that the entire anime is known for its animation. Given its excellent animation and, oh, let's not forget, its memorable BGM, it's bound to have some incredible action.</p>

			<p>Action in KNY is widely and justifiably attributed to its brilliant animation. The studio of Ufotable gained a huge name among KNY fans due to its animation and screenplay. That's not the only thing that makes the action in KNY special, though; the BGM used in KNY is especially heart-touching at times. It can be completely in rhythm with the situation in the picture, bringing a much better elevation to the depiction. However, Ufotable is balanced in the sense that it has kept its focus on only one anime, unlike a certain other black company. With that, let's explore some fan-favourite fights from KNY, let's gooo.</p>

			<h3> Rengoku vs Akaza </h3>

			<p>This fight is regarded as the key contributor to the film's success as a box office record. The portion of the film that comes before said fight firmly establishes the nature of Rengoku as a kind and strong person. Establishing Pathos within the audience, the fight had most of the audience strapped to their chairs. Then, there's Akaza; his sudden, unexpected appearance, followed by his position, portrayed how tough an opponent he was even before the fight started. Akaza's theme was really great. The fight proceeded with the exchange of blows between Rengoku and Akaza, during which Akaza applauded Rengoku on his skills, asking him to be a demon so that he could be Akaza's sparring partner. Of course, Rengoku denied him every time, making the populace like him more every time. But as the respect for Rengoku increased, so did his wounds. <s>In his final moments, he uttered, "With this treasure, I summon," and became a doughnut to defeat Akaza</s>. In Rengoku's final attack, Rengoku (meaning "purgatory" or “hellfire”), the stunning animation, music, and emotional buildup culminated in a visually and emotionally impactful finale.</p>

			<p>Small trivia:
				<ul>
					<li> • This fight started around the last 30 min when the movie is 2 hours in duration.</li>
					<li> • In this fight, Rengoku performs the first five forms of flame breathing in succession and then the ninth form, Rengoku.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3> Tengen Uzui vs Gyutaro </h3>

			<p>This fight takes place in the 10th episode of “Entertainment District Arc”, Season 2 of KNY. Particularly referring to the part where Tengen and Tanjiro fight Gyutaro for the last time, this fight has been hailed as a fan-favourite by many, and rightfully so.</p>

			<p>The author of KNY uses mundane biological feats to hype his characters. This is well observed in season 1 of KNY, where Tanjiro undergoes elevated inhuman training, and in the Mugen Train movie, where Rengoku asks Tanjiro to use breathing techniques to stop bleeding and Rengoku, in his final moments tightens his gut to lock Akaza in place.</p>

			<p>In this fight, Tengen exchanges blows with the likes of Gyutaro, even with one of his hands cut. Until then, the fight was almost one-sided, with Gyutaro winning, but this fight was different. Tengen analyzed Gyutaro throughout the fight and used his Musical Score technique to fight toe-to-toe, creating one of the best fights in the entire series. In many of my friends' opinions, this was their favourite fight. And I agree, this fight was a masterpiece, given how much action was in it. The musical score technique was only used in this fight over the entire series, which is a shame, considering how well the concept was executed. The fight with the animation, BGM and visuals was just <i><b>chef's kiss</b></i>.
			
			<p> The final blow from Tanjiro's side, in sync with the blow from Inosuke and Zenitsu on Daki, ended the fight, giving the first victory to the demon slayer corps over an upper rank after more than 100 years.</p>

			<h3> Conclusion </h3>

			<p>In summary, Kimetsu No Yaiba's action sequences, exemplified by battles like Rengoku versus Akaza and Tengen Uzui versus Gyutaro, redefine anime excellence. With meticulous animation, emotive storytelling, and unforgettable soundtracks, these fights captivate audiences worldwide. Each clash symbolizes more than combat, embodying character growth and narrative depth. As fans celebrate these iconic moments, Kimetsu No Yaiba's action aspect cements its legacy in anime history, setting a new standard for creative brilliance and emotional impact.</p>
