			<p>A little old school anime? Yes. Lacking in artstyle as it might be, this show nonetheless delivers what every single anime we’ve ever watched couldn’t do so perfectly. The second season is much better than the first because the first is a bit slow-paced and you might think it's ordinary. The amount of misery and pain the programme forces upon you is so overwhelming that despair may as well set in. A word of caution then: if you watch this show, make sure you stick with it all the way through, or else don't blame us for recommending something that caused you the trauma of a lifetime. There are several anime that can bring you to tears, but none quite like this one. Every single episode contains enough red flags to cause PTSD. You won't find another anime that so accurately captures a character's problems, their environment and resulting characteristics, their strained relationships, and their mutual love. Therefore, I would say that even if this isn't the typical high school rom-com, it may be the most relatable and realistic relationship you've ever seen. The two main protagonists are not the only focus of the novel; it also explores how their relationships with friends, family, and circumstances affect their daily lives. Lastly, this anime features the cutest child character I’ve ever seen, so if you like some wholesome parent child drama, this show gives you another incentive to watch it.</p>
