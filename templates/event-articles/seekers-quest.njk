			Hey, MASK. I know you've been conducting some quizzes for a while now. It's all good, but I feel like something has changed.<br>
			I mean, it's kinda boring how we just sit in Vikramshila with our computers, attempting a quiz in a room full of people, without really discussing with our friends.<br>
			Wouldn't it be better if you did something, I don't know, which I can enjoy with my friends or something?

		&emsp;- Nobody. This narration is fixtional. The next part, not so much.</span>

	With this line of thought, we decided that it was time we let go of our online link and proceed with a completely offline event for teams. The <b>Anime Seekers' Quest</b> was a treasure hunt planned shortly after the <a href="/events/qatq" title="Quad Anime Trivia Quiz">Quad Anime Trivia Quiz</a>. Teams of upto 3 people spent 2 hours, using the clues provided and their anime knowledge (and Google... yes, we allowed it. ) around 2.2 covering various locations in a quest to claim their prizes from a treasure curated just for the anime fans.

	With everything going on in the campus, we had a wonderful response from the participants. As the sun went down, the event ended as a beautiful success. We would like to congratulate those who won the event:
