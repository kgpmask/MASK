				<p>For all the fellow romance anime enthusiasts out there, the Winter 2023 season has been an amazing start to the new year with the return of playful Nagatoro-san while also introducing us to some new gems like Tomo-chan, Kubo-san, and the angelic Mahiru Shiina-san (>'-'<).</p>

				<p>But all these diabetes-inducing anime are not just limited to this season. We&rsquo;ve got one oh-so-sweet, oh-so-warm anime waiting for us in the next season!! And what awaits us in the coming season, or, should I say, next door, is nothing short of a galaxy.</p>

				<p>The anime adaptation of the manga Otonari ni Ginga (&ldquo;A Galaxy Next Door&rdquo;) was announced last year and is set to be released on April 8, 2023, along with a television drama too.</p>

				<p>After graduating from high school, Ichiro Kuga made his debut as a manga artist, but after his father died, he worked hard every day to support his young siblings by himself. Just by this much, you know that this is not going to be your stereotypical &ldquo;guy quits his passion to support his siblings&rdquo; plot point. It&rsquo;s becoming difficult to keep up with his growing deadlines and responsibilities, and to top all that, his last two assistants quit to make their own debuts.  It&rsquo;s getting out of hand for Kuga to manage everything. But just then, she appears: Kuga&rsquo;s knight in a black dress! Yes, you read it correctly. Shiori Goshiki, an extremely competent and equally beautiful lady, applies to become his new assistant. Goshiki helps Kuga meet his deadline, and Kuga&rsquo;s life seems to be back on track&mdash;or does it? There&rsquo;s something otherworldly about Goshiki, and an accident (a happy one, perhaps) will get them both engaged.</p>

				<p>Otonari ni Ginga is a tale that depicts how unnatural circumstances can lead to something beautiful. Although Kuga and Goshiki seem to share a bond as soon as the story begins, this won&rsquo;t let you miss out on the &ldquo;slowly falling in love&rdquo; side of the story. These are two level-headed adults who are trying to deal with the situation they found themselves in. There is no love at first sight here. It's a slow but pleasant burn. Their development is gradual and very interesting because none of it is cartoonish or played for fun, though the situations themselves will elicit some chuckles from the audience.</p>

				<p>So far, five volumes of the manga have been released. The author of the manga, Gido Amagakure, has done significant work in slice-of-life and romance. He is popular for his work &ldquo;Sweetness and Lightning,&rdquo; which was also adapted into an anime. The amount of wholesomeness in &ldquo;Sweetness and Lightning&rdquo; makes us anticipate similar levels of wholesomeness in this one too.</p>

				<p>The manga is great so far. The story is well-paced, and the mixture of romance and fiction in a slice-of-life setting is very refreshing and gives all the right feels. If you&rsquo;re a romance anime fan and don&rsquo;t mind a laid-back story, this is the anime you should be looking forward to. </p>

			<h2>Webtoon Review: Yumi&rsquo;s Cells</h2>

			<div class="article-content">
				<p class="c1">Being a bit too loyal to its name, the 512-chapter Korean webtoon (originally titled Yumiui Sepodeul) by <b>Donggun Lee</b>&nbsp;is about the daily
				titbits of the titular protagonist Kim Yumi&rsquo;s brain cells as they affect the mood, decisions, and
				relationships of their owner.</p>
				<p>The webtoon got an initial Korean release on <b>Naver</b>
					and is being serialised between April 1, 2015, and November 13, 2020. It was later
						translated into English by <b>LINE</b>.</p>
				<p>Having mastered the slice-of-life and office genres, Donggun Lee is no new name to
						the fans of <i>Daily Jojo</i>. With Yumi&rsquo;s Cells, however,
						the Korean Webtoon author has outdone himself.</p>
				<br/><center><img src="/assets/releases/2023-02-1/2.webp" style="max-width: 40%; display: block;"></center><br/>
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yumi's Cells, while falling into the same genres, is a breath of fresh air compared to a reader's expectations of a light rom-com. The accurate depiction of the inner tussle that goes on subconsciously in the average person's head 24 hours a day, seven days a week, hits home. And the storm of thoughts and internal dilemmas that go on behind every small decision in Yumi&rsquo;s life feel personal.</span></p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plot of the webtoon is as simple as it gets. Our 32-year-old office-going female protagonist, Kim Yumi, has recently developed a crush on Wook, a younger employee at work. Yumi&rsquo;s prime cell is the Love Cell; hence, her prime focus is to have a fulfilling love life, as is reflected in the superior powers that her Love Cell gets in decision-making, often overriding numerous other cells.</span></p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Character building is the life force of this webtoon. Yumi herself has an entirely different dimension when it comes to character depth. Through the interactions and reminiscing of her cells, we get to know her past and the triggers that still control her behaviour. Be it the constant arguments between her Rational and Emotional Cells or the sublimity of her Priority Board, Yumi feels more than just another character. At the end of every chapter, the reader is bound to have grown more invested in her character development because of the sheer nature of the story, which is driven by her mental and emotional changes.</span></p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cells themselves seem to have a personality of their own. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love Cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enjoys the position of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the leader of all the other cells) and is overly defensive of what Yumi loves. The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rational Cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is undoubtedly the one logical cell that gets the most done and yet gets ignored a lot, primarily due to the overly sentimental </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotional Cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or the unduly sensitive </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anxiety Cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The combined interaction of the cells makes the webtoon so much more entertaining than your average slice-of-life fiction.</span></p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the human characters play an important role in the plot as well. Yumi&rsquo;s colleague </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruby </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">is again such a fresh change from the usual pretty-mean-girl trope. With the similar cellular character development of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woong</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Yumi&rsquo;s nerd boyfriend, the readers get a tense taste of subtle confusion in emotional understanding between two individuals, which could make or break a relationship. The details following the inner conversations of the cells are simple yet spectacularly beautiful.</span></p>
				<br/><center><img src="/assets/releases/2023-02-1/3.webp" style="max-width: 50%; display: block;"></center><br/>
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, Yumi&rsquo;s Cells is yet another rom-com about a woman striving to find purpose and love in life. But it leaves a mark with its unique approach. The characters feel real, and the attention given to emotions and long-drawn decision-making sequences doesn&rsquo;t feel dragging. The artwork is cute, and the language is spiced up with some hilarious-sounding vocabulary (take </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">One-Step-Behind Cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example).</span></p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Yumi&rsquo;s Cells is a must-read webtoon for everyone, regardless of one&rsquo;s genre preferences. But it holds a particular charm for those invested in character-oriented fiction and wholesome manhwas.</span></p>

				<br/><center><img src="/assets/releases/2023-02-1/4.webp" style="max-width: 35%; display: block;"></center><br/>
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the anime and manga series "</span><strong>Your Lie in April</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">," the theme of incomplete love is central and recurring. The series explores the idea that love isn't always enough, and that there are outside factors that keep two people apart. "</span><strong>Your Lie in April</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">" characters each have their own experiences with incomplete love, and the series uses their journeys to illuminate the complex nature of love and its many facets.</span></p>
				<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unrequited love is a prominent form of incomplete love in the series. The main character, </span><strong>Kōsei Arima</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has strong feelings for </span><strong>Kaori Miyazono</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but she is unable to reciprocate his feelings due to her own personal struggles and limitations. Kōsei's experience with unrequited love serves as a reminder that not all love stories end joyfully, and that the person we love may not always love us back. This unfulfilled love causes heartbreak for both Kōsei and Kaori, as they struggle to accept their feelings and find a way forward.</span></p>
				<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In "</span><strong>Your Lie in April</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">" another type of incomplete love is love that is never fully realized due to external factors. Kaori's health issues, for example, prevent her from fully embracing her feelings for Kōsei, while Kōsei's own emotional issues prevent him from fully opening up to Kaori. These external factors serve to emphasize the idea that love is not always enough, and that there are often other forces at work that keep two people apart.</span></p>
				<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incomplete love can also be seen in the relationships of the series' other characters.</span><strong> Tsubaki Sawabe</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, has feelings for Ksei but is unable to confess her feelings due to her own insecurities and fears. Tsubaki suffers heartbreak as a result of her incomplete love, as she must accept the possibility that her love will never be fully realized.</span></p>
				<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the heartbreak and disappointment of the love stories in "</span><strong>Your Lie in April</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">," the series emphasizes the idea that love can still have a profound impact on our lives. The series demonstrates through Kōsei and Kaori's relationship that love can be a source of comfort, support, and healing, even if it is never fully realized. Furthermore, the series investigates the concept of incomplete love as a catalyst for growth and change, assisting us in better understanding ourselves and the world around us.</span></p>
				<p><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><strong>Your Lie in April</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">" is a heartfelt and thought-provoking series that explores the theme of incomplete love. Whether it is unrequited love or love that is never fully realized due to external factors, the series demonstrates that love is not always enough, and that there are often other forces at work that keep two people apart. It also emphasizes the idea that love can have a profound impact on our lives even if it is never fully realized, and that it can be a source of comfort, support, and healing. Whether you like anime, music, or just good storytelling, it is a series that will stick with you.</span></p>
