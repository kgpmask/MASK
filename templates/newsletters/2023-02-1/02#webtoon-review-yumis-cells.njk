			<p class="c1">Being a bit too loyal to its name, the 512-chapter Korean webtoon (originally titled Yumiui Sepodeul) by <b>Donggun Lee</b>&nbsp;is about the daily
			titbits of the titular protagonist Kim Yumi&rsquo;s brain cells as they affect the mood, decisions, and
			relationships of their owner.</p>
			<p>The webtoon got an initial Korean release on <b>Naver</b>
				and is being serialised between April 1, 2015, and November 13, 2020. It was later
					translated into English by <b>LINE</b>.</p>
			<p>Having mastered the slice-of-life and office genres, Donggun Lee is no new name to
					the fans of <i>Daily Jojo</i>. With Yumi&rsquo;s Cells, however,
					the Korean Webtoon author has outdone himself.</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yumi's Cells, while falling into the same genres, is a breath of fresh air compared to a reader's expectations of a light rom-com. The accurate depiction of the inner tussle that goes on subconsciously in the average person's head 24 hours a day, seven days a week, hits home. And the storm of thoughts and internal dilemmas that go on behind every small decision in Yumi&rsquo;s life feel personal.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plot of the webtoon is as simple as it gets. Our 32-year-old office-going female protagonist, Kim Yumi, has recently developed a crush on Wook, a younger employee at work. Yumi&rsquo;s prime cell is the Love Cell; hence, her prime focus is to have a fulfilling love life, as is reflected in the superior powers that her Love Cell gets in decision-making, often overriding numerous other cells.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Character building is the life force of this webtoon. Yumi herself has an entirely different dimension when it comes to character depth. Through the interactions and reminiscing of her cells, we get to know her past and the triggers that still control her behaviour. Be it the constant arguments between her Rational and Emotional Cells or the sublimity of her Priority Board, Yumi feels more than just another character. At the end of every chapter, the reader is bound to have grown more invested in her character development because of the sheer nature of the story, which is driven by her mental and emotional changes.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cells themselves seem to have a personality of their own. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love Cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enjoys the position of the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the leader of all the other cells) and is overly defensive of what Yumi loves. The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rational Cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is undoubtedly the one logical cell that gets the most done and yet gets ignored a lot, primarily due to the overly sentimental </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotional Cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or the unduly sensitive </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anxiety Cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The combined interaction of the cells makes the webtoon so much more entertaining than your average slice-of-life fiction.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the human characters play an important role in the plot as well. Yumi&rsquo;s colleague </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruby </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">is again such a fresh change from the usual pretty-mean-girl trope. With the similar cellular character development of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woong</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Yumi&rsquo;s nerd boyfriend, the readers get a tense taste of subtle confusion in emotional understanding between two individuals, which could make or break a relationship. The details following the inner conversations of the cells are simple yet spectacularly beautiful.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, Yumi&rsquo;s Cells is yet another rom-com about a woman striving to find purpose and love in life. But it leaves a mark with its unique approach. The characters feel real, and the attention given to emotions and long-drawn decision-making sequences doesn&rsquo;t feel dragging. The artwork is cute, and the language is spiced up with some hilarious-sounding vocabulary (take </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">One-Step-Behind Cell</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example).</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Yumi&rsquo;s Cells is a must-read webtoon for everyone, regardless of one&rsquo;s genre preferences. But it holds a particular charm for those invested in character-oriented fiction and wholesome manhwas.</span></p>
