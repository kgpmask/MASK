			<p>Written and illustrated by Osamu Nishi, Mairimashita! Iruma-Kun is an ongoing Japanese manga, published by Akita Shoten in the magazine Weekly Shonen Champion every Thursday. It is available digitally and can be bought from multiple vendors. As of yet, no official English translations exist, but third party translators have made it available in English. The mangaka has written another series before, Hotel Helheim, serialized in Jump SQ. There is one manga spinoff, Makai no Shuyaku wa Wareware da!, which is co-authored by Koneshima and co-illustrated by Atsushi Tsudanuma. It takes place in the same world as that of Mairimashita! Iruma-Kun, but it focuses on the events of different characters not featured in the main series.</p>
			<p>The manga is mainly set in Netherworld(Makai), a world separate from that of humans, populated by demons and magical beasts, and filled with magic. Humans are considered mythical creatures and most demons aren’t aware of their existence. Demons are characterised by their compulsion to follow their desire without any caution. This results in selfishness and violence being their dominant nature.</p>

			<p>Iruma is a 14 year old human boy who is sold to a demon by his parents. The demon, Sullivan, takes him to the Netherworld where he adopts Iruma as his grandson and he is enrolled into Devil School Babyls. The story is built up around Iruma, his classmates and follows the events which unfortunately make him stand out. Why is it unfortunate? This is due to a little fact that even though humans are considered non-existent, they are heavily implied to be food in demon lore. Iruma, being a human and aware of this, tries his best to not stand out but fails to do so every time. The events are focused on the ambitions of the characters and their struggle as they progress towards their goal. The author has done a commendable job of setting up interesting plot points indicating there is more to Netherworld than what meets the eye till now. The pacing of the story is a bit slow, but on the plus side it gives the author a chance to flesh out the story. As a result, around 200 chapters have been spent only in the first year of Iruma’s school life. From all indications, it seems like this is going to be a very long-running manga as even the Netherworld seems to have been explored barely till now. Though this should not give you the wrong idea that this is going to be  a boring story - on the contrary it is actually a very engaging read. What stands out most is the subtle humour present in this manga that lends to a pleasant reading experience.</p>
			<p>The manga has myriads of interesting and some bizarre characters with their own quirks. Each demon has their own unique bloodline magic which makes the character more intriguing. The characters closer to the protagonist are given much more development compared to others, but overall even the minor characters explored to some degree.</p>
			<p>The art of this manga is good enough. It forgoes the details in artwork in favour of simplicity but doesn’t feel that lacking and gains some of it back in clarity. Panelling in a few of the earlier chapters feels a bit cramped but it quickly becomes better. The flow of  dialogues is easy to follow for the most part, but it becomes a struggle if there are too many speech bubbles on a single page which can be a bit annoying at times to follow.</p>
			<p>If you are a person who enjoys a long-running manga and has a knack for fantasy and isekai themes, you should give it a try. As of now, the story is still being molded and with a lot of hard work from the author combined with a bit of luck, it might turn out to be a fulfilling one to follow!</p>
