						<p>This anime has it all, from the incredibly lovable Marin Kitagawa to the dedicated and passionate dreamer Gojou Wakana, to their endearing chemistry and their bonding over Marin's love of cosplay. Marin is undeniably the show's best character; she's just too sweet and outgoing while also being far too adorable. Gojou is an exceptionally kind individual who is passionate about creating "Hina dolls," his grandfather's hobby that he fell in love with. Gojou has created exquisite clothing for his hina dolls, while Marin loves cosplay but is only competent at sewing rubbish clothes. Their unexpected meeting changes everything for them both, whether it is Marin's goal of cosplaying, which felt incredibly surreal, or Gojou's passion towards his hobby, which is not seen as a “cool” by society, which over time led to his introversion. Although they primarily work on cosplay, the romance aspect of this show is fairly well defined, and it's wonderful to see how they gradually grow aware of one another as the episode progresses. The two's antics will keep you amused at all times while you madly simp on Marin. Do you desire a simple story with elements of romance and humour? This anime is perfect for you.</p>
