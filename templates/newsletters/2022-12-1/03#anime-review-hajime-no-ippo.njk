			<p>After you have ripped and burned everything you have, what makes you stand? What makes you see the end? For a person like Ippo, it is his will to endure, his will to fight, and his will to win no matter what. This journey of Ippo is what will be presented to you in the animated series called "Hajime no Ippo."</p>

			<p>Hajime no Ippo is a Japanese boxing-themed manga series written and illustrated by George Morikawa. It has been serialized by Kodansha in Weekly Shnen Magazine since October 1989 and collected into 133 tankbon volumes as of March 2022. The anime has had 3 seasons, 1 TV film, and 1 OVA. Many fans are awaiting the return of the anime with a new season.</p>
			<p>The anime takes place in Japan and revolves around the main character, Makunouchi Ippo. Ippo is a character that many would call "too kind for his own good." In the beginning of the anime, we see that Ippo works really hard between his school and job to support his mother. It is clearly implied that his father has already passed away, and therefore he has quite the burden to handle. He also has another problem: being bullied by three of his classmates. Those 3 attack him mentally and physically simply for the sake of it.And it is implied that Ippo has been a victim of their bullying for a long time because he didn't and couldn't fight back against them. Though this bullying was ultimately what led to his journey as a pro-boxer starting,</p>
			<p>The first season of the anime was released in 2000, which explains why it has the raw and rough texture that is characteristic of many of the older anime. The fight animation in the anime makes you crave for more, and the sound track and sound effects used during the fights take it up a notch. (Especially the use of shotgun firing sounds and jet plane sounds for punches.) The use of soundtracks in the anime is one of the best that I have ever seen.</p>

			<p>The story of anime is one that uses the age-old Shonen story structure as its base, though that doesn't make its story less interesting. That's because it isn't a singular rise of the protagonist with ever-increasing power and feats; the protagonist has to suffer, he has to face defeats, and he gets into situations that he finds difficult to overcome. Also, the anime isn't solely focused on the main character; we get various episodes on the backstory and feats of many side characters. Also, anime tends to keep the characters consistent over time. The various training sessions shown in the anime are powerful enough to make any of us viewers want to train in real life.</p>
			<p>The continuous character development of the protagonist is something I loved while matching the anime. He slowly develops his self-confidence, and he begins to pursue his goal towards the top of boxing.</p>
			<p>For anyone looking for an intense and energetic sports anime, I would definitely recommend this. Even outside the sports genre, this anime is a gem.</p>
