			<h3>Visual Novels: Interactive Storytelling</h3>

			<p>I suppose it is time to write an article about an extremely niche topic that almost no one has heard of and definitely no one has asked for - Visual Novels. Why yes, dear reader, it may be surprising to you, but there are more elusive forms of Japanese content than anime, manga, and even doujins.</p>

			<p>Before delving into the topic, let me first explain what a Visual Novel even is. Most casual anime watchers may be unfamiliar with the concept, which is quite a shame. If done well, it is an extremely compelling medium with much to offer through its unique style of storytelling. A Visual Novel is an interactive video game that relies on images and text to narrate a story. The ‘Gameplay’ tends to be limited to a few choices that the player can make to alter the story's path, leading to different story ‘routes’. So, think of it as a branching novel or movie, with different endings and outcomes based on the player’s decisions. The first-person style of storytelling and choice system leads to greater immersion in the story. This unique style of storytelling has produced many hidden gems which have acquired the status of cult classics in the West.</p>

			<h3>Challenges in Adapting</h3>

			<p>I hope you have gotten a basic understanding of what a Visual Novel is (if not, I would recommend you to watch this YouTube video A Beginner's Guide to Visual Novels).</p>

			<p>Let’s dissect the problem of anime adaptation of Visual Novels. Let’s start with the obvious issue first: Anime and Visual Novels are two vastly different media, oftentimes conflicting in nature, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Visual Novels are usually much longer than your average anime (some spanning over 100+ hours of gameplay) and are extremely text-heavy. This extended format allows for far more creative freedom to develop the story and characters. Condensing this into a 4 to 20 (in rare cases) hour-long anime wrecks the pacing and forces content to get cut out. Also, storytelling in anime tends to be based more on visuals than dialogue, so the original nuance and message of a Visual Novel may be lost in its adaptation.</p>

			<p>A common thread connecting most Visual Novels is that they are in First-person perspective (prime self-insert material). These inner monologues play an integral role in forming the protagonist’s character, but I am sure you realize how difficult it will be to adapt that to anime form. Some series find creative alternatives to this, as you will see in later segments. But most ignore it completely, creating shallow cardboard cutouts of the characters. The power of Visual Novels lies in the gradual culmination of small interactions that build character dynamics and plot threads. Rushing through this creates a less satisfying and inferior product.</p>

			<h3>Underwhelming Adaptations</h3>

			<p>And don’t just take my word on the fact that adaptations are bad; let’s turn to the most reliable and unbiased source of anime reviews on the internet, MyAnimeList. Here’s a list of extremely popular and critically acclaimed Visual Novels that have received an anime adaptation with scores below 7: ChaoS;HEAd, Dies Irae, Tsukihime, Muv-Luv Alternative, Ace Attorney, Umineko, and the list goes on. Even shows with a score greater than 7 leave much to be desired; Grisaia no Kajitsu is a rushed adaptation of a 50+ hour-long Visual novel into 13 episodes. Despite the Visual Novel being very popular, especially in the West, the anime ruined itself by attempting to cram all the content into a mere 13 episodes. This leads to lackluster character development and less impactful scenes as compared to the Visual Novel. This anime serves as a prime example of a show that, despite its potential, diminishes itself into a mere advertisement of the original Visual Novel.</p>

			<p>The Japanese, known for their efficiency, decided to do something similar with Danganronpa. It, too, suffers from the fate of having 30 hours of content crammed into 12 episodes. It prioritizes the main storyline over character development, because who cares about characters, right? They are just background props for the story anyway. This weak characterization made character interactions feel inauthentic and forced for the sake of plot progression, ultimately leaving a lot of viewers dissatisfied.</p>

			<p>White Album 2 was a great adaptation with solid character development and a compelling plotline, as reflected by its scores. But, it only covers the Introductory Chapter (first 1/3rd, and arguably the weaker section) of the Visual Novel and ends up serving solely as a promotion tool for the Visual Novel.</p>

			<p>A popular joke in the Fate/Stay Night community is that Saber’s route in the Visual Novel had never been adapted because of how infamously bad studio DEEN’s adaptation was.</p>

			<p>For a brief comparison, let's compare this with another database site, Anime-Planet. Anime-Planet has marked 364 anime adaptations to be based on a visual novel, of which only 20 have a score above 8/10, which is the baseline standard for a good show. As you can see, there is no shortage of shows to scoff at, so let’s move on from this topic before I end up spending ten pages venting about these adaptations.</p>

			<h3>Pitfalls of the Anime Industry</h3>

			<p>Despite there being some great adaptations like Steins;Gate, Clannad, Fate/Stay Night UBW, and Heaven’s Feel, the majority struggle to deliver a satisfactory show. Why is this so? If a handful of shows are capable of producing high-quality adaptations, it seems reasonable to expect others to do the same. That would be true if we lived in a utopian society, but sadly, that isn’t the case. Reality hits us with a few roadblocks: money and manpower. When making an anime, various factors are considered when deciding on the direction of the adaptation, one of the major ones being the target audience. Visual Novel adaptations usually target people familiar with the game who know what they are watching. The fast-paced nature and omission of plot threads may confuse newcomers to the show. But for people who already know the plot, there is some enjoyment in seeing characters they love brought to life in the anime format. These adaptations also prioritize showcasing flashy fight sequences and major story events quickly so as to grab the viewer’s attention and expect them to fill in the blank spaces. They do this while sacrificing the gradual development of characters, which is a central aspect in most Visual Novels.</p>

			<p>Another common theme among most adaptations is that they act as a promotional medium for their original work, rather than being a standalone piece of media. This can also be noticed in manga and Light Novel adaptations, but it is a much more acute issue in this case. Studios create flashy shows to entice people to play the Visual Novel and boost series sales, but in the process, they often end up producing a mediocre show, which is not good as a standalone show.</p>

			<h3>Limitations of Creativity</h3>

			<center><img src="/assets/releases/2024-02-1/2-11.webp" alt="Steins;Gate" style="width: calc(min(700px, 60vw));"></center><br>

			<p>Shows like Steins;Gate have used creative ways to overcome the barriers of Visual Novels by focusing on a linear storyline and properly fleshing out characters for the show's first ten episodes before moving the narrative forward. It kept some of Okabe’s more important monologues while also effectively using facial expressions and voices. These changes didn’t detract from the original but rather enhanced it and transformed it into a highly memorable series.</p>

			<center><img src="/assets/releases/2024-02-1/2-12.webp" alt="Timeline" style="width: calc(min(700px, 60vw));"></center><br>

			<p>Another very popular adaptation, that uses an entirely different approach from Steins;Gate is the Fate Series. In this series, each route (three in the original Visual Novel) was given its own anime adaptation (Fate, Unlimited BladeWorks, Heaven’s Feel), giving each character enough time to develop in their respective arcs and making the story much more engaging and the conclusions more meaningful. Despite having some minor qualms about how Shirou’s character was dealt with (maybe another time), the UBW and HF adaptations are stellar, both in terms of action sequences and character interactions.</p>

			<center><img src="/assets/releases/2024-02-1/2-13.webp" alt="Stare Eyes" style="width: calc(min(700px, 60vw));"></center><br>

			<p>Creativity and a deep understanding of the original work are necessary to make adaptations of such caliber, and low-budget projects just aren’t up to the task. The primary aim of these shows is to quickly make an anime for airing and to increase sales of the original work. So, creative use of the strengths of the anime medium and analysis of what made the original work popular is largely ignored. If the studio can’t understand or capture the true essence of the Visual Novel, how can one expect it to be a good adaptation?</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>

			<p>At present, most adaptations are used merely as flashy advertisements for the Visual Novel. It is reasonably effective at that task and helps bolster sales and promote the source work, but it leads to subpar (or just plain bad) anime. In the future, there is potential for change if studios and producers prioritize delivering quality shows over generating profits. However, this transformation seems as unlikely as NGNL S2, given the current emphasis on low-budget productions. While fans continue to hope for more faithful adaptations, only time will tell if these demands are ever met.</p>
