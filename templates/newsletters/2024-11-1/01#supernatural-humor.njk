			<h4>Basic introductions</h4>

			<p>Well, most of us have thought about this once in our lifetime that being attractive could solve most of our problems in schools and colleges. So let's explore an anime where you will see immense problems and perks of being beautiful from our main female character, komi-san, and the way of solving her problem will give you a hard laugh.</p>

			<h4>Origin and Storyline</h4>

			<p>Komi Can’t Communicate is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tomohita Oda, and its anime was aired in 2021. The series is centred around a high school girl who suffers from extreme social anxiety and struggles to communicate with others wanna guess who that high school girl is? It's our own Komi-san; it's hard to believe, isn’t it, that a girl this gorgeous doesn’t know how to converse.“But remember, Just Because A Person Has Problems Communicating Doesn't Mean That Person Doesn't Want To Communicate With Others”. and just like that Komi also tries to communicate with others. With the help of her classmate Hitohito Tadano, they embark on a mission to make 100 friends and improve Komi's communication skills. In this journey, she meets different people like Tadano(MMC), Najimi(everybody's mutual), Yamai(the obsessed one), Agari(lapdog), Nakanaka(living in her world), etc. After going through hardship(which will make you laugh) and facing problems together, komi accomplishes her goal of creating 100 friends but still can't talk properly.</p>

			<h4>Let's talk about a review of anime.</h4>

			<p>The animation is vibrant and expressive, capturing the characters' emotions effectively. The character designs are good, especially Komi’s. The animation quality is consistent, making it enjoyable to watch.</p>

			<p>The series also addresses themes of communication, anxiety, and friendship, resonating with anyone who has faced social challenges. At its core, "Komi Can't Communicate" delivers a positive message about the importance of communication.

			<p>The series provides good humour, and it often arises because of misunderstandings and the awkwardness of social interactions between characters, which leads to some incredibly hilarious situations.</p>

			<p>This anime, too, has some shortcomings, such as the animation could be better, there are pacing issues in early episodes, and they tend to rely heavily on repetitive gags and jokes, which may irritate you sometimes.</p>

			<center><h3><i><b>The Comedy of Chaos: Saiki Kusuo’s Daily Life</b></i></h3></center>

			<h4>Basic introduction</h4>

			<p>I bet every one of us has thought at least once in our life that if we had superpowers, life would be easy(even I wanted teleportation and telekinesis). We felt that if we had them, our lives would have no problems, but is that true?</p>

			<p>Well, let's explore an anime where a boy has many superpowers but still suffers from a lot of problems. The way he uses his powers to solve those problems will make you laugh a lot.</p>

			<h4>Origin and Storyline</h4>

			<p>The Disastrous Life of Saiki K (Saiki Kusuo no Psi-nan) is a Japanese manga and anime series created by Shuichi Asou and was aired in 2016. The anime has two seasons. The series revolves around a kid named Saiki who was born with extraordinary supernatural abilities such as telekinesis, levitation, x-ray vision, clairvoyance, astral projection, pyrokinesis, mind control, psychometrics, invisibility, and a lot more. Believe it or not, his only wish is to live an everyday life, which is a considerable challenge given his extraordinary abilities and the colourful characters around him. So, he prefers to keep a low profile and avoid drawing attention to himself, which often leads to laughable dilemmas. While going through high school, he makes a lot of troublesome friends(in his thoughts) like Nendou(a lovable dim-witted brute), Kaido(a wannabe hero), Teruhashi(a beautiful narcissist), Hairo(energetic CR), Yumehara(bearing crush on Saiki), and many more. The dynamic between Saiki and his oddball classmates is the primary source of endless comedic tension. His deadpan reactions to their personalities keep the humour fresh and lighthearted. The series effectively uses visual gags and clever dialogue to maintain a lighthearted tone, appealing to a broad audience. Its comedic style is reminiscent of classic sitcoms, where misunderstandings and character quirks drive the humour.</p>

			<h4>So yeah, let's talk about a review of anime.</h4>

			<p>It sets a unique premise: combining a high school setting with psychic abilities provides a fresh take on the slice-of-life genre. The series subtly explores themes of isolation, friendship, and the desire for normalcy.</p>

			<p>The vibrant and expressive animation captures the humour and defining character traits beautifully. The character designs are distinct and memorable, with each character’s quirks reflected in their appearances.</p>

			<p>The series excels in clever writing, featuring sharp dialogue, situational comedy, and visual gags that keep viewers laughing. The pacing is rapid, keeping the audience engaged with quick punchlines and hilarious misunderstandings. Saiki’s internal monologues provide insight into his frustrations, making viewers empathise with his desire for peace amidst chaos.</p>

			<p>While being one of the best comedy anime, it also has some things that could be improved, such as a fast-paced style that can result in rushed storylines, leading to character arcs that need to be developed. Some viewers may find that the humour can become repetitive over time, which might lead to diminishing returns for long-term viewers. The comedic tone often means that there are less severe stakes. This may feel somewhat lacking for viewers looking for more intense drama or character development.</p>

			<p>But still, overall, it's one of the best comedy and slice-of-life anime around, and if you’re seeking a fun series that captures the absurdities of everyday life through a unique lens, "Saiki K." is definitely worth adding to your watchlist.</p>
