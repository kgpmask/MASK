			<h3>Shangri-La Frontier (The Anime/Manga):</h3>

			<p>Shangri-La Frontier: Crappy Game Hunter Challenges God-Tier Game is a Japanese anime series based on the Shangri-La Frontier manga series by Katarina and Ryosuke Fuji.</p>

			<p>The anime takes place in an age where display-based games are considered retro and full-dive VR games have become the norm.

His gaming skills are second to none, and no game is too bad for him to enjoy. So what happens when he's introduced to the new god-tier VR game Shangri-La Frontier?</p>

			<h3>Shangri-La Frontier (The Game):</h3>
			<p>Shangri-La Frontier is a god-tier game in an age of full-dive VR games, which you can play just using your mind. SLF is a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) that has a vast and beautiful open world. You have to make a character, pick a role for yourself, and delve into the massive world where you level up by killing monsters, can interact with other players and NPC's, and also experience quests and unique scenarios.</p>

			<p>The world of SLF is full of all kinds of monsters, and their level is usually balanced for specific areas. The monsters can be killed, and they would respawn in time. Each has the option to drop items or materials. There are seven unique monsters known as "The Seven Colossi," which can spawn anywhere at anytime, and killing them is permanent; they won't respawn. The story progresses if any player kills one of these seven unique monsters.</p>
