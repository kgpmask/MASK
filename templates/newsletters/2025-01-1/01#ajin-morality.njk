			<p>How do you define what is right and what is wrong? One widespread basis for the definition of morality is religion. However, the moral codes of most faiths are outdated in the present times (we don’t want slavery again, do we?). Now, how do we decide for ourselves if there is no God to tell us what’s good and evil? The basis for morality in the 21st century is empathy. It’s broadly accepted that we should not do something to hurt others and value the lives of humans. But what would happen if there existed a minority of a few immortal humans? How will society treat them when their lives can’t be endangered by anything except old age? The story of Ajin: Demi-Human deals with this interesting question. Let’s dive into the nitty gritty of Ajin in a not spoiler-free way!</p>

			<h3>What are Demi-Humans in Ajin?</h3>

			<p>Demi-humans are immortal humans. The only thing that can kill them is old age. An essential rule for their regeneration is that they always regenerate from the largest body part that exists. This means that if you are a demi-human and you have cut your finger, then it will regenerate as you would expect. But if your cut finger is intact and your body is minced or burnt, you would regenerate through your finger. If you just regenerate your finger, then it’s not that much of a hassle. But how do you suddenly get that much matter to form when regenerating your entire body from a finger? This is explained by the existence of Invisible Black Matter (IBM), which is the source of Ajin’s powers. IBM also allows Ajins to summon a black ghost, which can be used to attack and defend and can only be seen by other demi-humans. </p>

			<h3>The Treatment of Demi-Humans in the Story.</h3>

			<p>As you would expect, they are being used for scientific research in a not-so-humane way. Demi-humans can’t die but can get unconscious by anesthesia or other methods. What can immortality do for you when you are strapped? Now, don’t forget that they can still feel pain. If a demi-human gets caught by scientists, it becomes a living hell for them. All sorts of medicine and technology are tested on them. This definitely shortens the testing period for medicines, but this is clearly inhuman treatment. We, as readers, can feel it as we read the story from the point of view of demi-humans. But why was this practiced in the story?</p>

			<h3>The Origin of Discrimination and Cruelty.</h3>

			<p>People discriminate against others when they are scared or disgusted by them. But this all comes back to one point - they feel the other person is different. Differences (which are inevitable) are the primary reason for discrimination. The survival of humanity depended upon forming closely bonded communities in the past. Anything that threatens their community’s values is seen as dangerous, and anyone different from them is discriminated against. The feeling of empathy that drives morality does not arise for the victim of discrimination by the discriminator. This is the reason why inhumane experiments were being run on demi-humans because they are different from normal mortal humans. Don’t get me wrong; in the story, the public felt conflicted when it was revealed that the government was funding these experiments, but not much was done. What do you expect when the victims of such cruelty find a messiah who promises to liberate them?</p>

			<h3>The Retaliation of Demi-Humans and Sato.</h3>

			<p>Sato (Samuel T. Owen), who is arguably one of the best villains, is a demi-human who gathered other demi-humans to start a series of terrorist attacks in response to the inhumane treatment of demi-humans by the government. Do you remember the reason why Germans elected Hitler? They were in an economic crisis because of the Treaty of Versailles and the Great Depression. Hitler promised to liberate them from this crisis, and the rest is history. Sato made the attacks purely for his own amusement under the disguise of a rebellion for rights. By the time other demi-humans understood his intentions, it was too late. Just like Hitler, he was successful in propaganda, and later, when he acquired power, he started acting out what he really intended. (Spoiler alert) Sato was so dominant in the entire story that even at the very end, he could’ve fled but still chose to get caught because of his interest in Kei Nagai (Our Protagonist). Sato abandoned his morality as he understood the potential of immortality. </p>

			<h3>Mortality and Morality</h3>

			<p>Nothing is as priceless as life. Our entire framework of morality is based on preserving life, especially human life. Ajin is an excellent demonstration that immortality makes it easy for a person to wreak havoc in the world (in the case of Sato). This also means that the immortals can be discriminated against, as displayed in the story. Your decisions will change if you find that you are immortal. It is considered immoral to get drunk too much or indulge in drugs. The reason for this is that it harms your body. Now, you are immortal. Of course, a drug overdose won’t kill you. But this still creates lots of problems for the society if you use drugs. Immortality renders useless, one of the most critical Ten Commandments- Thou shall not kill. The moral values of a society where immortals exist will differ from our world.</p>
			
			<p>Additionally, the morals will change according to the ratio of immortals and mortals. As shown in Ajin, if mortals are the majority, they will find a way to subjugate the immortals. Just like that, immortals would practice cruelty on mortals if they were in the minority. Even if the immortals were not the majority, they could use their abilities to overpower mortal humans. </p>

			<p>Ajin displays how immortality can be a boon or a curse, depending on the situation. It also analyzes the behavior of society and how our morals function. Ajin: Demi-Human by Gamon Sakurai has a manga and an anime adaptation. I haven’t watched the anime, but I can assure you that the manga is worth checking out. I have not talked about the protagonist, Kei Nagai, but the dynamic of Sato and Nagai and the tension between them throughout the manga is really amazing. Sato is my favorite villain in animanga, so check out Ajin: Demi-Human if you haven’t already!!!!!!</p>
