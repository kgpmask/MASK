			<p>The narrative is set in a realistic world where an unknown organism has invaded Earth and taken over human bodies. One of these organisms is inadvertently trying to enter a sleeping youngster called Shinichi Izumi's body, but the monster can only take over Shinichi's hand. Shinichi's right hand eventually becomes home to a strange monster formed by the tragedy. Meanwhile, other creatures that have successfully taken over the bodies of humans and animals have begun to assault and consume the civilians in stealth. As a result of this knowledge, Shinichi resolved to use his new right hand, Migi's assistance in fighting more violent parasites. The story isn't overly complicated, and the premise is simple to grasp and retain.</p>
			<p>The animation is very ordinary. The character design is ample. The parasite design is adorable. It is well-illustrated and memorable. It succeeds in conveying a bleak and frightening atmosphere to the screen. Every beat in the background music just makes the plot even more exciting.</p>
			<p>Our primary characters are Izumi Shinichi and Migi, the extra-terrestrial that lives in his right arm. Izumi Shinichi's character development is concentrated on him; from the beginning to the end, Shinichi's attitude and looks change. He develops into a more mature and dependable guy from a sniffing and cowardly child. The progression is nicely described. While Migi, the parasite that lives in Shinichi's hand, plays an important role in the story, the two develop a relationship as the plot progresses. While many villains with diverse motives also performed admirably in their parts, the other supporting characters also did a good job in their role.</p>
			<p>At the end of the day Parasyte is just another great anime to binge watch.</p>
