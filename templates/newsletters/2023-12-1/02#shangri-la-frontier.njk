			<p>When anime intertwines with gaming themes, thoughts often gravitate toward the representation of video games. Beyond sports and gambling, the focus narrows down to a theme closer to the media itself: Video Games. Anime, manga, and light novels have consistently featured video game-related narratives, undergoing notable transformations over the years. From adaptations of visual novels and role-playing games to showcasing characters engaged in RPGs, the prevailing theme now illuminates the trajectory of gaming's future: Virtual Reality.</p>

			<p>Within the realm of anime, numerous interpretations of virtual worlds have emerged, with the ".hack//" series standing out as an early exploration into a game world from a player's perspective. Reflecting on the intersection of VR and anime, one iconic title surfaces: Sword Art Online. This anime revolutionised the anime landscape and coined the term 'isekai' as a genre. However, did it truly capture the essence of VR's potential? Opinions differ. While Sword Art Online depicted full-dive VR as capable of simulating every conceivable sensation and emotions, it fell short of fully exploring the profound capabilities and significance of such technological marvels. Along its narrative journey, the portrayal of games and VR dwindled to the mere existence of fantasy elements in the real world—a perspective that, in my view, fails to do justice to the immense potential at hand.</p>

			<p>Since then, numerous series have explored the fusion of games and VR in diverse ways. Whether it's being trapped within a game, as seen in Log Horizon and Overlord, or breaking down the boundaries between games and reality with augmented reality, as depicted in Accel World, whereas, in the past two years have witnessed a saturation of the "isekai into a game or novel" theme. One notable VR gaming anime from a couple of years ago, "Full Dive: This Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shittier than Real Life!", centred entirely on the VR gaming experience, highlighting the challenges and discomforts associated with it. However, despite these varied narratives, none of them truly delved into the potential of a VR experience. We were yet to see an anime that envisioned what VR could truly offer. The most significant issue? Many of us failed to recognize the bias and ignorance inherent in our perspectives, overlooking what could potentially mark one of the most significant evolutions in the gaming industry since the advent of DVD and PlayStation.</p>


			<p>Everyone's got their go-to recreational activity, a hobby that keeps them engaged. Some dive into books, others binge-watch TV shows or movies, and then there are those who find their joy in gaming. Now, here's a question for the gamers out there. Ever delved into the worlds of Elder Scrolls, RDR, or any other single-player RPG? Did it hit the sweet spot for you? Ventured into the realm of MMORPG, maybe something like Albion? And the big question: have you ever strapped on a VR headset? Now, let's cut to the chase—have you ever wondered what it would be like to jump into an open-world VR-MMORPG, connecting with players worldwide, where your character and gameplay choices are entirely in your hands, offering a fully immersive VR experience? It's not a question you come across every day, right? So, how was it for you? Thrilling? Heart-pounding?</p>

			<p>"Shangri La Frontier" offers a captivating exploration, going beyond mere expectations! The protagonist, an avid gamer with a liking for subpar titles, has navigated through every game marred by terrible gameplay, poor mechanics, bugs, or unfavourable deals for regular players. Upon encountering a true masterpiece, the protagonist, more than anyone else, discovers the beauty within the game—intricate mechanics, splendid physics, precise controls, and a complex yet immersive plot. With a vast player base, a myriad of classes and occupations, and a plethora of guilds for various activities, the anime transcends the typical narrative of a high schooler with exceptional gaming skills. On a deeper level, it delves into realms beyond mere tomfoolery, with the author's clear vision evident in meticulous world-building, well-balanced power scaling, and myriads of abilities seamlessly integrated together, all the while maintaining the constant reminder of the virtual gaming environment. The animation is nothing short of impressive, leaving audiences in awe, and the action choreography rivals even the most renowned shows, solidifying "Shangri La Frontier" as the unexpected standout of the Winter 2023 season. While it may not receive the full credit it merits, this anime has unquestionably etched itself into the annals of VR-based anime.</p>

			<p>"Shangri La Frontier" masterfully presents the ideal fusion of plot, setting, and animation. It stands out as an anime devoid of stakes and explicit objectives, featuring a protagonist who, though adept at gaming, navigates through the virtual world without the typical "I am the hero" aura. Instead, he grapples with challenges, faces mortality, experiences frustration, gets cornered, panics, yet rises to fight again—an authentic portrayal of the struggles and triumphs familiar to any regular gamer.</p>

			<p>The storyline lacks overtly distinctive elements, but it is precisely the simplicity of the premise, the depth of the setting, the ordinariness of the plot, and the high-quality animation that converge to create an absolute masterpiece. "Shangri La Frontier" not only showcases the infinite possibilities of an ideal MMO-RPG but also underscores the boundless potential inherent in a full-dive VR system.</p>

			<p>This show not only showcased the depth and potential of technology but also delved into the intricacies of the player base. It explored how many of us swiftly skip through the long cutscenes at the start, hurriedly create our characters, disregard tutorials, and eagerly plunge into the game. "Shangri La Frontier" delves into the existence of player killers, the players' avid pursuit of superior equipment and skills, and the perplexity and chaos experienced when encountering unexpected scenarios in a new game.</p>

			<p>The anime captures the essence of how most players resort to online forums, such as Reddit, to seek solutions or engage in discussions about a particular scenario. It mirrors the common inclination to search for cheats, tips, and tricks. While not every aspect is played out by the same character, observing the various characters and scenarios encountered by the protagonist in "Shangri La Frontier" reveals a true and accurate representation of a masterpiece VRMMORPG being played by individuals worldwide.</p>
