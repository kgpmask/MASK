			<p>KonoSuba: God’s blessing on this wonderful world, also simply abbreviated to KonoSuba!, is an anime adaptation made to promote the light novel by the same name. It also has a manga adaptation originally illustrated by Mashaito Watari and Joseph Yokobori. The anime has 2 seasons adapted by Studio Deen and a movie adapted by J.C. Staff. Also, a new project was just recently announced creating ecstasy among fans.</p>

			<p>Like any other Isekai genre, this anime also follows the main protagonist Satou Kazuma after being teleported to a fantasy world following his death, which for him happened in a hilarious way where he died of shock from an accident rather than the accident itself.</p>
			<p>Before his journey in the fantasy world, Kazuma meets the goddess Aqua, who gives him the option to have any one thing before embarking on his journey . He chooses Aqua herself, only to regret later regret this since she's practically useless and doesn’t possess any significant magic to be of much help. Later in that world, Megumin, an arch witch, and Darkness, a crusader also joins the troop, though they don’t add much value since Megumin can only use Explosion magic and can’t move after casting it, while Darkness is the stand-alone tank but with zero damage accuracy.</p>
			<p>The anime follows the daily life struggles of the troop to survive in the fantasy world by completing quests (though they mess each one up). The story doesn't hold much character development and plot, but what goes in the box is its parodic illustration and hilarious moments which surely tickle a funny bone or two. The comic portrayal of the anomalies of all the characters fits well in the illustration. The anime is not a full-fledged show because it only has 10 episodes in each season (apart from OVA), but it still is good for its short duration.</p>
			<p>On an overall scale,  Studio Deen has done well in the animation but it still falls short in some places (which is how they do things). Praises go to J.C.Staff for some good animation in explosion scenes in the movie, though. Although the music, OPs and EDs are quite decent, the anime doesn't lose its lustre. KonoSuba! is a recommended watch for fans who love hilarious comedy, and we must admit this show does make us laugh a lot.</p>
